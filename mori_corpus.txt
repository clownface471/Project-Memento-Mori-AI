Let me let me let me say don't don't misinterpret. Okay. I like this game. I love this game. But at the end of this stream, I'm uninstalling it at whatever point we get to. So, if we don't finish it today, I don't care. It's coming off of the hard drive. Gone. Out of steam. Goodbye. Done. We're moving on. I don't No more. Yeah. It's a great game though. I love this game. It's awesome. 10 out of 10. No, it is. No, it is. It is good though. It's good. God, you could even hear me. I even like you could hear my my averted eye contact with that one. It's good. You didn't even have to see me. You could hear me like not be able to look you in the eyes as I said it. Wow. That's That's embarrassing. All right. Wait. Let me see you first. You can't even see me. You can't even see this right now. I can't even. I can't even. Will I play the new Resident Evil? Absolutely. Day one release. Abso freaking totally lootly. Did you see there's like this clip I saw on Twitter? Maybe they showed this at Gamescom, but I still haven't finished watching the Gamescom trailers. But the enemies can throw furniture at you. That's going to make me so mad. I'm so excited. That's going to get me so angry. That's going to be funny, too. Throws an entire bookshelf. She'll stop at 85% at that one, too. At that one, too. I'm sorry. Two. Where are you right now? Where do you think you are right now? You're going to eat those words at the end of the stream and I will feed them to you myself. Go pick out your favorite baby spoon. Here comes the plane. But then I take away the spoon and it's actually me feeding you a knuckle sandwich with all five of my digits curled up. And I'm going to put your first name, the first letter of your first name on each of my knuckles. Wait, why do I have my music going? How many audio can you guys hear right now? Is there like 11 layers to I should pull up another audio. Let's pull up some royalty-free um Flight of the Bumblebee to really make this an experience. [Music] I don't know. I'm letting my food settle so I don't throw up. So I don't throw up. Let me talk through my gird real quick. Am I a streamer? What's like a royalty-ree song? What's like a like the royalty-ree song? What is like a royalty-free song? What is a What is is Mozart royaltyree now? What is a royaltyree? Mozart. Mozart is royaltyree, isn't he? He should be Beethoven. How do you spell that? Beat oven. Beethoven. The best of Beethoven. The best of Beethoven. Classical music. The best of Beethoven. Wait, no. What's that one? This isn't even a funny bit I'm doing. It's It's crazy. Um, a lot of classical pieces are copyrighted. Moonlight Sonatada. I'm laughing so hard right now, bro. Wait, what was funny about 35 seconds ago? I'm too scared to click any of these hand can music. Is that going to get me in trouble? Wait a minute. Hello. Hello. Hello. I didn't play it. I didn't play it. I threatened. I thought about it. I thought about it, YouTube, but I didn't actually play it. It's fine. I didn't actually play it. You don't have I didn't play it. I thought about it. I hovered. I hovered over it. Okay. But I didn't actually click it. I didn't I didn't click anything. There's no There's no There's There's I didn't play nothing. I didn't play anything. I hovered. Look, I closed the window. The window is gone. It's gone. YouTube, you don't have to worry about it. Everything's fine. Everything's fine. Are we back? Hello. I didn't I didn't touch anything. [Music] All right. Um, anyway, let's uh let's um let's uh let's play God, I almost called this Devil May Cry. Let's play Resident Evil. I don't even play anything. I just thought about it. YouTube can read your mind now. YouTube can read your mind now. Terrifying. Okay, we good. What was I going to say? Oh, I mean, not much has happened since we last spoke, so I don't have like crazy things to talk about. Let's see. What did I do? I went to bed. I woke up. up. I answered some business emails. I did some other businessy things like outfit planning and stream planning and calendar calendaring. And then what did I do? Oh, I made a there's there's this thing that I saw that you can make a iced Americano with coconut water instead of regular water. An iced Americano is when you take icy cold water and you pour a shot of espresso over the top of it. There's no milk or anything and I don't think you usually you can use sweetened coffee but I don't think you typically do. Um it tasted like an iced americano. There was nothing there was like nothing to write home about with it. It's just I guess the idea that the Oh, the coconut water. You're hydrating while you're dehydrating because c coffee is a dehydrator is a unhydrator and coconut water is like a hydrator. But yeah, I don't know. Also, coconut water is just really expensive, too. So, I I don't know. I wasn't impressed by it. I wasn't impressed, but I'm going to drink it anyway. It did make a really good smoothie, though. I recommend that one. Sounds awful. It's not that bad. It's not that bad. It ain't that bad. Oh, also, God, I'm feeling so autuminal. I'm feeling incredibly autumnal, which means that Christmas is like leaking into my bloodstream a little bit. The, you know, Mariah Carey in the background. Yeah. Well, she's getting louder in my ears. It's time, guys. It's coming. You know, August is almost over and September 1st means by hour or in September, right? Nah. Um, so you know what that means? Christmas is coming. Jingle bell, jingle bell. But it had me thinking about this experience that I had that I have to tell you about. So about like two or so years ago, I was listening to some random Christmasy music channel of some sort. like a live stream just Christmas music in the background like um and I was I was reading about the live chat because why not cuz it was open I don't know spying on the the live chat whatever whoever chat it was and I saw this conversation happening um and it was interesting it was an interesting conversation it was people without any profile pictures just their like regular uh like very very white and uh Sophia uh uh name that kind of thing. No, no usernames or anything. But anyway, uh wait, what did I call the guy? I'm I'm assuming Barry. Barry was looking for Sophia in this live chat. Have you seen Sophia? Sophia, are you there? Sophia, hello. Sophia, are you there? Hello, Sophia. I'm like, okay, this guy's looking for somebody. Um, and then Sophia shows up and Barry goes, "Oh my gosh, I I've missed you. I've missed you. Where have you been?" I thought, "Okay, they must know each other then." And Sophia was like, "Oh, you know, I was doing some house chores and whatnot, but I'm back now." And Barry goes, "Oh, I missed you so much. Oh, how I missed you so my my Sophia, my love." And my eyes like June laser like lock on sight. I was like, I have to chatter's in love. They were literally I think they were in love. Well, actually, no. I know. So, they were in love because it started off kind of cute. I thought, this is nice, I guess. Um, this is a public room, but all right, I'm going to watch I'm going to see how this goes down. So, I am watching the Animal Planet essentially. And um they have some regular conversation from what I remember. And then uh Barry all of a sudden goes, "Sophia, I love you and I want to be with you. Where are you? Come to me. Where do you live? You want to know where I live? And I I'm thinking Barry is not about to do what I think Barry is about to do in this very public live stream chat. Barry, don't do it. Barry, stop. Barry and Sophia. I don't remember what Sophia said. It's It's so cruel. I don't remember what she said, but essentially Barry decided to give his entire full Barry did it. Barry gave his entire full address, the zip code, everything. was like, "Please, please come to me, Sophia. I love you. Sophia, please." I said, "Barry, no." And the other people that were just watching the I guess he he had a bit of an audience, I suppose. Uh, but the other people were like, "Barry, you have to delete that. Barry, delete that right now. Barry, you got to delete that, dude." Yeah. Barry also gave his full phone number and said, "Please text me, Sophia. I love you so. We need to be together. Let's meet up. Come here. Come. This is where I live. This is my house. Please, please come to the What is going on here, Barry? No, Barry. Not like this." Every time Every time August comes around and the weather starts feeling a bit more like autumn and such and Christmas, I'm always reminded of Berry. And I always wonder how Barry's doing now. Twist. It wasn't actually his address. It could have not been. I don't know why. Why would you do that, though? Why if he didn't actually mean it? If he was not actually that serious. Like, it seems a bit odd in a Christmas in a 24-hour Christmas music YouTube live stream chat. Confess your love to this random person you don't know. Barry took the risk. Barry definitely took a risk. Who's Barry? You zoned out. Um, Barry is a YouTube chatter that fell in love with another YouTube chatter and decided to give his full his full address and phone number in the YouTube live chat to meet up with this with this other chatter that that they fell in love with. Crazy. Very entertaining. A little worrisome. And I hope Barry's doing all right. But anyway, let's play Resident Evil. But did it work? I don't know. I never chimed in. I didn't chime in. I just wanted to watch. Very entertaining. [Music] [Music] Welcome back to Resident Evil 4, part five, the series finale. Chapter 15 of 18. 15 16 17 18. Where are we? I don't know.

Krower. Kaiser. Krower. Roll. What if it I don't think it worked for Barrier. I don't think he he met the the YouTube chatter of his dreams. I don't think I I'm thinking it didn't work.

It really helps me relax. Really clears my mind, you know. I gota I got to reapply the grip tape on my controller, you know. I just got to Isaac pumping iron, you know. Yeah, we can share our our meal, our our macros for the day. We could do macro share show and tell. Actually, macro show and tell might be fun cuz I'm pretty I'm pretty I'm pretty into that discussion. I like macros. Those are fun. Those are fun. I simply wish to share this gift with as many as possible. A humble wish, don't you think? You see, we are all connected through the holy body. Holy above. Now your flesh and bones, your very thoughts are already one with us. Ah, it's like a hive mind. You guys are the holy body. No, you're not a hive mind. Serenity when you need only accept the sacred gift. Yeah. Like she did, Southern. Ah, yes. The time has come. This lamb to join our covenant. Oh, blessings on you and the mercy they bring. Exalt all and let it be done. Chris, is Chris in this game? Go. Bring the girl. You know how hard it must be to carry a dead weight body like that? That must be insane. That must be incredibly difficult. Ashley. Oh, wait. Ashley. Damn it. Laboratory B. Looks like it's this way. All right. Straight line. Can't miss it. Thank you very much. Just dead. Wait, leave her be. Oh, the hell. Ooh, just drag her. I feel like dragging might be easier at this point than carrying like this, especially if she's also suffering. [ __ ] I'm losing it. Yeah. You take lay her down on her back, put her feet up into your armpits, and then just walk forward. Just clamp down around her armpit. Your your feet. Clamp her armpits around her feet and just walk forward. That'll be fine. That'll be way easier than carrying her. Just use her face to push open this door. Still you resist. That would also be funny. His armpits. Come on, Leo. And he's our man. If Leon can't do it, no one can. Leon. Leon. Leon is strong. He's resilient. He's all He takes his job very seriously. Super soldier Leon. Actually though, when was the last time you were in this like I'm trying to think of an equivalent of of the last time I felt like this. Did he die? No, it's not streaming. I was going to make a sad excuse like a audio snack in the middle of the night kind of thing. Wait, Louis is alive. The Louis key. He's actually alive. He's actually here. He's going to go surprise. This time it has to be different. I was going to ask a dark question. Who would be more worthwhile to save? Leon the super soldier or Ashley. Listen, if we could only save one, I'm just saying. No way. Leon has proved himself. I'm going to get you home safe. I would have closed the door behind me just saying no. And he's a hacker, man. Here goes nothing. [Music] [Music] and that's why I never wish to be a voice actor. Hey, glad you could make it today. Awesome. For the next six hours, we're going to want screams. You are being purged of a Leon.

This is a transactional experience. You are literally No, no, no. No, Leon. All of this removing the parasites. This was Luis. Luis? Yeah, we're alive. Thanks to him. I'm surprised this thing even booted up. Whoops. The dream team. He works for Umbrella at least does. Hey, Danny. And uh he was doing the I'm going to read his emails. No, he's just just talking about nerdy stuff. Someone had a field day looting the umbrella labs. [Music] Yeah, he used to till he died. Wait, how did he die again? Didn't A kill him? Ah. Ah. This is from Ada. Regarding our arrangement from Louis. I have compiled the research data that you wanted me and the designated time and place.

Anyway, um, Hatsu Miko means a lot to me and she's really important during my young formative teenage years. Is anybody else I don't know if anybody else can relate to that. Maybe you are in your young formative teenage years right now and you are also oddly attached to the virtual singing idol girl named Hatsuniku. Uh, and today's her birthday.

It doesn't matter what level of school you're in. If you're high school, middle school, or you're like university, you're going to look back on this and be like, "Ah, that was good." You're going to smell a pencil in about 10 years and say, "You know what? I missed that." You're going to get you're going to pull a what do they call? Tanderoga pencil to your nose. So, you're going to open a drawer in your house and get a whiff of pencils and erasers and it's going to take you back 10 years. I don't know. I'm I'm ball ballparking ballparking. Do I miss school? No. But but everybody's different. You know, you know what I miss? I miss the Scholastic book there. All right. That's what I miss. You know what? That's technically that's not school, but it is technically also school. Yeah, that's what I miss. [Music] The Scholastic book fair. Get in the little paper magazines and you get to go down and buy everything that wasn't a book. Yeah, the big pencils. Did you have the big massive pencils? I got a massive pencil. as I remember. And what else did I get? Oh my god, I had those uh What? Why is it CocaCola brand? For some reason, it's telling me it's Coke brand, but I don't think it is. But it was these little like friendship books you would fill out. You would ask your friends a bunch of questions like I don't know, do you how how your name here, how many uh Oreos can you fit in your mouth? Uh, what's your favorite color? And it's just stuff to I guess it's stuff to ask your like friends sleepover type things. Yeah, I filled in most of that by myself. No friends needed. All me, baby. How many boogers do you have? More like how many boogers can you eat, [Music] Sagge? Um, yeah, maybe a little bit. But it was fun. I don't look on it badly. I look on it happily. Well, cuz here's the thing, though. Books like that, they were expensive. And if if if your parents said, "I will buy you this," then I want to fill it out on my terms. I don't want somebody else to fill it out. I don't want to fill it out with anybody else but me. Now I sound like I'm just Is that copium? Yeah. Well, anyway, uh to today we're playing, uh the Meiku game. Today we're playing Hatsi Miku. Hats me. [Music] What is this game? This is a rhythm game. This is a rhythm game. This is my ball bar. My wheelhouse. This is my wheelhouse here, kiddos. See, I got thinking about Scholastic and now I'm going to start sounding extra elderly. Um, this is my these are my type of games. This is the one game type where we do not have to play on baby mode. Easy mode is is not selectable. I will rage if I have to play easy mode. You know what? I'm going to play one song on easy, you know, just to feel something. Just to feel rage, just to see. I actually do terribly on easy and normal. Um I think because I've um me muscle memory this game. Yeah. So, this is the one game I can say there is no baby mode for me. Um Yeah. All right. Let's play. Let's play. Oh, what was I going to say? Oh, I had a thought. I was thinking about how all of these things I wanted to do for this stream, like I wanted to have uh input display, but it turns out I'd have to like roll back to a specific version of OBS to get it to work, and I didn't have enough time. I didn't feel like doing that. Um, so there's no input display this time, but I was like, "Oh, I should get input display." And it'd be fun to like do a heart rate monitor and then like show uh other things. And then I started feeling like a like a like a test subject. I don't know. It just felt a little weird to be playing it. Just playing a video game. Like what what are you doing? What are you What are you doing? All right, let's uh boot up the game. I was going to say something else. I don't remember. [Music] What was I going to say? Oh, I wanted to share this is appropriate. I wanted to share a life lesson. Is this mine? That is me. Okay. You didn't say how I was. How How am I doing? Yeah, I'm fine. I'm good. All right. I'm a little tired, but otherwise I'm Okie dokie. How you doing, Big Mac? All right. Not for yourself. I was going to say something. I'm going to share a life lesson that Hatsune Miku taught me as I grew up with the the the the heart, the voice, the game. I actually I took away a life lesson from this game. This game is incredibly frustrating if you don't know how to play it or if you're bad at it. I understand. Um, but this game taught me that because when you get a note wrong, it kind of makes you you can easily get frazzled and then you just keep messing up and then you'll lose and you have to start over. But this game, one lesson this game taught me and Miku therefore also taught me uh is that even if things go wrong, you cannot uh stick to them and instead you have to keep going forward. Yes. You literally have to move on from your mistake in that moment, otherwise you're going to have a terrible time. Does that Does that make sense? I don't know. I probably could have said that a whole lot better. Um, okay. So, something I forgot about this game is that um I have to unlock everything first to get it to extreme. So, for the past like hour and a half, I've been trying to unlock everything. Is this easy one? Okay, we'll play on easy. Which one should we do on easy? [Music] A VR rhythm game. I'm bad at VR rhythm games. Let's do this one. I'm going to get so mad. Also, I can't sing along. The audio sync delay is going to be really annoying for you if I sing along. Actually, I'm going to do it just to annoy you. Ready for this? [Music] You see what I mean? [Music] It's a sing. party time. [Music] This was the Wasn't this like the the song the theme song for the DS version? They had a Hudson Miku for the 3DS. I think this was like the uh opener. [Music] I'm so concentrated right now. This is harder than I did. [Music] Mide DX. Yes. [Music] I played that game so much. That game is fantastic because if you went too long without playing Marx, um, whoever you had in your little Vocaloid house, [Music] whoever you had in your little house, Miku, Lynn, Oh. Uhoh. They would be mad at you. You would have to beg for forgiveness. I'm not kidding. Hop on your mic and beg for forgiveness. I wish I was kidding, but I'm not. Either you would have to verbally beg or you would have to tap this button like probably 250 times. [Music] Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. [Music] And then and then and then and then and you like offer Miku for example, who's who I kept in my little house. I kept Miku in my house. Oh wow. I haven't seen this. Oh wow. [Music] Wait, they had this in the old PS uh VA version. The what is this? Chance. [Music] She wasn't in my basement. She had the whole house to herself. I was more so like I was the guest in her house, but she was in my house nonetheless. [Music] Um, I had to feed her, entertain her, and play with her. And uh, okay, that wasn't that bad. How is that harder than hard mode? [Music] Not [Music] It is too slow. [Music] Yeah. N Oh, wait. That's the There it is. That's the That's the the art, the album art right there. That's Maria. They like look like little ninja characters. They're really cute. It's a good game. [Music] I don't remember anything else about it. What do I know about Tito? Tito. Tito. Tito. Anytime [Music] Tito shows up on my timeline, like on Twitter, it's always just the most feral I've ever seen. It's just like TTO is here. Tito is rabid. Tito will bite you. I'm like, why? Why? It's like a potted plant and somebody put Tikto's face on it and it's like hit Pikto here. What do you Why? What do you want? What do you want from me? Um, let me just see if there's any other ones on here that I want. [Music] Take the word of the day. [Music] [Music] Am I Am I quiet? Let me turn myself up. Just kidding. I'm going turn the game down instead. [Music] Just kidding. Um, [Music] oh yeah, if you have a song you want me to do, just go ahead and you can let me know. I think I have I just favored my actual favorites, but uh I'm playing on an Xbox controller, too, which is just abysmal. goes against all my muscle memory. This is a good song, by the way. This is Did you say goated? This is goated. This is a good song. Oh, I got to play another song too with a really sick with a really sick um title [Music] scheme. [Music] More [Music] [Music] speech. [Music] This is good on extra. Just you wait. Just Just you wait. Just [Music] This game is so hard to see. [Music] [Music] Fore! Foreign! Foreign! [Music] There's no uh dimming option in this game. So, uh, what you see is what you get. Yeah, you probably could mod it. I do not. This is the game. The game is as game is as is. They don't talk about those two. I couldn't I the left and the right hurt my eyes. I couldn't see. I couldn't see. Game audio is a bit delayed. Yeah, probably because I don't know. With um advanced mouth tracking, you have to kind of mess up the audio delay a little bit. Oh, maybe I could fix it for the game, but it's a based game. It's a pretty good game. I say this game plays the best on the PlayStation 4. Well, I'm pretty sure it probably plays the best on the arcade in the actual arcade version, but otherwise I would say it plays the best on the PS4, then on the PC, and then on the Switch. Um, I don't like how this plays on the Switch. I'll be honest. I feel like the inputs don't keep up with like extreme Yeah. Does that make sense? Oh, yeah. And on the the VA, I've never had issue with the like the PS VA. I've never played it on the PSP, but the PS Vita, I've never had issue with it like inputs and stuff. So, yeah. Um, I'm playing on an Xbox controller right now. I tried playing it on my 360 controller and that was a nightmare. It's probably I think it's the D-pad's fault cuz I feel like D-pads that don't separate. It feels like D-pads that don't separate the buttons enough. They kind of are easy to push two buttons at the same time. That's what it feels like. Maybe maybe I'm wrong, but so far on the Xbox, what is this? Xbox One X the S the the newest one. So far, this is all right. Um, I guess the only thing that is bad is it's the same with the Switch is the placement of the the JoyCons is really difficult uh to do with this game cuz they need to be in the same spot for accuracy for my muscle memory. So, sometimes I'll go to do the Joycon and it won't be there. I'll be like, "Wait a minute. Excuse me. Wait a second." All right. What else do we need? [Music] We could try a Pro Controller. Maybe [Music] tell your world. Oops. All right. Afterwards. Song is really good, too. The song's pretty good. Rolling girl. Ah, I have to do Rolling Girl, too. We'll play. They should unlock all the songs. D. [Music] Go down. [Music] [Music] I love how you can hear his vocals in the layered in the background. The male vocalist so good. odd [Laughter] [Music] That [Music] [Music] Yoch. [Music] when we go home. Back to back and we back to back. [Music] [Music] [Music] Sorry. Um, what was I saying? I like that song. I like that song a lot. Sorry if I kind of zoned in on that one. What was I going to say though? Oh, somebody asked earlier how I got above 100%. Um, I think with this game, if you really focus on the the hold when you when there's a note that says hold underneath it, if you hold that and if you uh assign it to a a macro on your controller so you can extend it while you focus on the other notes incoming. Hold notes. I think boost your score by a whole lot. So like holding and sliding if that makes sense. Holding and sliding and holding and sliding. But if you were to just uh tap cuz you don't have to hold the note. It does I mean you have to use the slidies otherwise you'll miss it. But if you don't hold a note they're not going to uh fail you for it. Um you just won't get as much of a score which is is whatever. Play how you want to play. Do the world is mine? Okay. Where is it? Where is it? Is it the world is mine? Yes, it is. [Music] I want some pain. [Music] Oh my [Music] It's your next [Music] No. [Music] I really have to count. 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 1 2 3 4 [Music] Oops. You guys tell when you play rhythm games. Am I the only one? I can't be the only one. Could you just go by feel? You tap your foot. No. Sometimes. Yes. [Music] Must dash [Music] my game. I love Mash. [Music] [Music] Yum. That is great. [Music] [Music] Yeah, I want to do Muse Dash. Muse Dash. Muse Dash. M Dash is so good. Muse Dash is one of those games that I like kind of feel like I black out when I play them in the best way possible. Can you play the Fortnite song? What's the Fortnite song? Wait, I was going to get mad at you, but what is the Fortnite song? Which song is in Fortnite? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. [Music] [Music] The one we just play was in Fortnite. Let's go. M. [Music] Oh god. [Music] World of mine and make mam. I mean, those are pretty good. I only know the part that goes make m. [Music] Let's see if I can remember my macros. She behind [Music] [Music] Yummy. [Music] [Music] Good. [Music] Nah, my me to the honey. [Music] Move my brother. [Music] I am pressy. [Music] Nana sayow [Music] [Music] meow. [Music] singing meow meow [Music] and fuzzy. [Music] Survived. Survived. Sweating. Sweating. But survived. [Music] A G. Okay, so in extreme um an excellence, so an E ranking is 95 and up. And then anything below that doesn't even matter. I'm just kidding. Anything below that, what is it? A fail. No, C is 70. 85 to 95 is great. And then uh 70 to 85 is see [Music] magical cure love shot is that in this game cursed. You know what is not in this game for some reason? This version there is no uh poka. It's in the tutorial, but it's like a weird remix version. It's It's like a weird remix version. I saw that. Actually, that's the original version. Yeah, it's like some some weird remix. I don't really Yeah. No leak song. It's not in there. I don't think it is in this one. It's in the PS4 version. After this one. Yeah. Oh god, I got my controller. [Music] Yummy money. [Music] [Music] Mario [Music] [Music] [Music] It's so good. Oops. [Music] I got it. Square confused. [Music] me the next [Music] Mario. [Music] [Music] Yeah. I just forgot where uh what is it? I got circle and square. Uh wait, what is it? Circle square and cir uh wait no circle square and x square mixed up on that last one on the three. Yes, this is like O but worse. What do you mean? In terms of not being able to blur the background. Yes. In terms of quality of game, I'm going to have to bite you on that one. I love this game. I love this game. I'll bite you. I'll fight you. I will fight you. I will. I will in terms of difficulty. No, I think O has some really really hard levels. Plus people that play O was the like hidden and it's all on your wrist. I call this game carpal tunnel. Uh the carpal tunnel game. I think O is probably the worst carpal tunnel game. I haven't played O in a very long time. I played O with the like keyboard and tablet with my little little little tablet drawing tablet. What did you guys say? Somebody said um wait recommended. What were you saying? [Music] No. [Music] I held really high on the leaderboard for this when it first came out. I was a sweaty uh scoreboard nerd. You believe it? Still sweaty. No, I don't upload my scores anymore. I don't score words. How to how to how to stop that. [Music] Yeah, their vocals are so good. I don't think this is just me, dude. Have they mixed reals? Have they mixed real vocals with a vocal song before? Watch as the monkey tries to speak and play at the same time. Tick tock. This is when text to speech or what you are saying would be ideal. Uh let's see if we got this. I remember somebody said I don't blink. When I play rhythm games, when I play dash, I'm teen years old. I remember like they she doesn't blink. So today I recorded me playing to make sure I blinked. Um I think I have I'm manual blinking. Oh, I didn't see that. Manual blinking. Manual copying. [Music] Manual breathing. I just locked in. Yeah,un dump. It was almost a full combo, but I didn't see the double. I should have known it cuz it was the last chorus, but I forgot. Whoops. Are the sound and video decent? It might be. It might be a little bit. I don't know how to fix that. How do I fix that? Do you guys know how to fix it? I was wondering earlier if it was like a case of I have to pick and choose. Either my voice is going to be distinct from my mouth or you're the streamer. But but I don't But you are the viewer. You are the viewing. It's fine. All right. I trust. I trust. professional viewer. You are technically. Well, yeah. [Music] Wait, we have to do um um um Oh, this one is really good. [Music] This one is crazy on extra extreme. Rolling girl. Okay, we got to do this one. Play peak. It is so good. This part on extreme is crazy. Look. [Music] Sorry, I should have done this before the stream. Wait, what am I saying? I'm sorry, I'm playing the game, guys. [Music] Sorry, I'm playing the game, guys. How dare I? What? Okay, from my understanding, this song is about a guy who falls in love with his art, [Music] his wife, who? It's OC maybe. [Music] which [Music] if I'm wrong, let me know. [Music] la. [Music] Yeah, it's pretty sad song, I think. [Music] [Music] again. [Music] She [Music] [Music] Give me the heart. Give me the [Music] [Music] let go. This is you should try singing this. [Music] Where were these skills when you played Resident Evil? Um, I don't know about you, but these skills won't transfer. Where do these skills transfer? Where do these skills even transfer? Where do rhythm game button inputs even transfer? One-sided. All right. That's my favorite. Wait, we have to do this one, too. [Music] Oh, I'm going to throw up. I just tripped my head too hard. Playing real music. Accuracy maybe. But I'm on a controller. Quick time button event. Yeah, there you go. If you have a quick time event to play, hand me the controller, child. Give me the controller. [Music] Uh, fighting. I've never tried a fighting game other than Smash. Does Smash count? [Music] Okay, I got to set up for this one. I got to set up. Smash is different. I get I'm so bad at Smash. Last time I played Smash, I just got laughed at. which is fine. Still had fun. [Music] She got [Music] shy. [Music] to [Music] the money. [Music] The song is going to kick my butt at the very end. I can already tell you I don't remember how to do those. [Music] chick. [Music] Sh. [Music] That might have been the controller. [Music] [Music] [Music] No, [Music] no. I was so close to it. E. [Music] Ah, I think the middle one. See, this is when you have to be so careful cuz the I don't know. I got to be cleaner with my D-pad hits. It's so good. This song is so good. It's so satisfying to play cuz they they give you I mean, there's a lot of the swishies. A lot of the squishy swishies, but there's also a lot of the I like the pure button presses. What controller? Xbox. I'm using Xbox with PlayStation inputs on screen because my muscle memory is tuned to PlayStation. So, I'm applying PlayStation buttons to my Xbox, but I'm pretending that I'm not playing an Xbox until the Joy-Con is appearing because then I need to remember that I'm playing on an Xbox. Whoops. [Music] No, I [Music] I feel like at Just Be Friends, I preferred this map over the extra. You're combining inputs. Yes. No. on screen. This is PlayStation, but in my hand there's an Xbox controller cuz I don't have a PlayStation. Okay. [Music] You must [Music] [Music] sad. [Music] I think extra extreme has more swishies on this map. That's why I don't really like it. [Music] Yeah. [Music] [Music] She could [Music] Oh my. Also on the PlayStation version, they had a specialty. You would hold down left and right. Give me a second. You would hold down left and right uh trigger and you would get these like special challenge where it would give you backto back like probably seven or eight songs and you had to hold the combo throughout the entire seven or eight songs. You had no breaks in between. It was so much fun. It was Those were so good. They don't have that in this one. Where is it? Where the sadistic music actually [Music] days? I have that on here. This is also good. What's the hardest song? Oh, probably this one. This one, actually. This one is very sweet on the outside, but very evil on the inside. This is the hardest song. Don't listen to anybody saying, "Oh, it's the intense the intense voice of the it's the disappearance of No, it's not. It's this one. It's Saiate. Hate is in the word. Want to try it? No. No, I did not. Cuz this song was in one of those um combo ones, those combo challenges on the PlayStation version. And this one would always kick my butt every single time and I would lose the whole thing. Anyway, where's the one you guys wanted? Where was one of them? Tell your world. Sorry. Tell [Music] 6.5. Yeah, on hard mode. On extra extreme, it's like a 9.5. It's harder than Sadistic Music Factory. Sadistic Music Factory. Why' I say it like that? Sorry. Foreign [Music] speech. Foreign speech. [Music] I can already hear you guys going, "Where's my light stick?" Saba, I wish to shake a light stick, you fish. Where's my light stick? Sorry. [Music] You're using bread. Oh god, I got distracted. Got to get very smart. [Music] So crafty. Adapt. Improvise. Overcome. [Music] Oh my god. Guess what game I finally tried? Hell Divers. I get the hype. [Music] I love Hell Divers. [Music] I can do it. [Music] For the democracy. I like when you have the jetpack on to the skies and you go like 2 feet in the air and then immediately eat afterwards. To the skies. What is that? What is that? Meiku, what is that? Slowing down like I'm talking over it. How was I supposed to know? Fancy a cup of liberty? [Music] Have I played Project Site? Have I? If I have, I don't remember. These are supposedly These are the hardest songs in the game, by the way. [Music] Pop. I throw up in my mouth. Po. Um. People. A B C D Q R S T L M N O P L M N O Q R Py. [Laughter] A Yes. This is the first Vocal song I ever heard. [Laughter] [Music] And when I saw it, they had the little animated versions of Kaio and Melo with their like nipple coverings on. I thought I was going to get in so much trouble for saying that. [Music] in the in the animated version. Have you seen that? It should be on uh YouTube still. Please, did I hallucinate that? No. [Music] [Music] Papa [Music] [Music] to play it on stream. No, no, the video. No, [Music] I mean if it's on YouTube, it's probably fun, right? Great. [Music] Pain shoes [Music] blue shoes. We daddy daddy daddy. Did she say she loves me? She's going to sell me juice and she's going to say she loves me. She can have my juice. I can have her juice. Give me your juice. I want her juice. What am I trying to say? $2 for vegetable juice? That's nothing. And she says she loves me. Absolutely. Consider me a customer. No, she loves me. Oh, yeah. DJ Max respect. Oh, I haven't played that in a really long time. I used to play DJ Maxx. I played a lot of DJ Maxx in like 2020 2020 2019 2020. I haven't played it since. Same with this game. I like this game a lot. I love this game, but I haven't played this game seriously since like 2019. Probably 2018, 2019. [Music] I keep forgetting Rolling Girl. I'm sorry. Let me just try this one. Oh god. Oh jeez. I perfected this in practice mode one time and I was upset cuz I thought, well, going to have to take that one to the memory banks. No one will ever see that. No record of it. [Music] No, no screenshot. I looked at chat. Whoops. Sorry, it's so tempting. It's your fault. Fighting for my life over here. No, I can't use my nose. [Music] I can't itch it. I can't reach. I can't take my hands off the controller. Oh Jesus. That was not good. Oh, the cramping. Ah, I'm an hour wet of this game. Two and a half now. All right. Well, I'm going to return to this. We'll return to this later. I need something. I need better than that. Oh, I should play it again right now. What should I do? I'm going to play it again. Oops. My hand slipped. Oh god. Whoops. Okay, I'm not going to look at chat. I'm going to focus in. I'm going to lock in. I might throw up. No, I won't. It's fine. Oh, that's loud. That's really loud. What did I do? Whoa, that's so loud. Awake. [Music] Yeah. Run it back. Just cuz I'm going to get better than the last time. [Music] This will not be the sadistic music factory stream. It won't. Don't worry about it. It Don't worry about it. Just don't worry about it. All right. [Music] [Music] Easy. [Music] I think it's the D-pad. looting around the D-pad. Fine. Happy birthday, Miku. No, that was me. That one was me. I got it. Don't worry. I saved it. What did I get last time? 94. Is this better than last time? It is the D-pad. Listen, I think that was worse than last time. Well, one more try. Just one more. One more. One one. Just one more. Sorry. Just one more. Don't worry about it. It's just It's nerves. It's nerves. That's all. Oh. Suddenly the the controller feels too big for my hands now. I'm nervous. I'm nervous. I'm going to Oh god. I'm going to Oh, it's going to I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. I might. I'm trying. [Music] I uh it Okay, the next fight's going to be clean. It's going to be so clean. [Music] Yes. Cleanish. Clean her. I'm gonna drop it. Don't Don't count on it. I'm going to pee myself. God, it's so close to an E. It's fine. It's fine. It's fine. [Music] Well, it's okay. That's fine. That's better. Yeah, it's fine. [Music] It's fine. All right. What's another one you guys wanted? What's one that I keep forgetting? This one? No. Which one? Rolling girl. Where is it? QR. [Music] Do they have the B people?

[Music] I can't tell if it's swinging there. [Music] Oh, that's funny. Oh, that's hilarious. [Music] Oh god, here we go. Oh god. Oh. [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] Give me [Music] [Music] [Music] See you. See you. I haven't done that in a very long time. [Music] I'll take that. I'll Yeah, it's not so bad. It's just a bunch of what do you say? Quads. Quad. Quads. It's just a bunch of the quad notes over and over and over and over again. The intense focus. Extreme Poke Po. I already did extreme Poke Po. I have my quads macroed to my uh uh the the triggers. Both triggers are macro to quads so that I can toss the hold notes back and forth. And I can also either I hit them with all of my fingers or I just tap the trigger if my hands are busy. Does that make sense? Play streamer talking. Shut up. Play. All right. All right. All right. All right. [Music] Stop talking to me, streamer, and start playing the game. I didn't come here to listen to you. D. [Music] [Music] [Music] R M R MK MPK. Fore! [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Okay.

[Music] Yeah, I need to try this again. I need to go and get a PS5 controller. Wait, does PS5 controller does that hook up to the PC like easily? Cuz I will go I'm going to go get one as soon as possible. It does cuz I like how the Xbox controllers, they just plug in. Yeah, I don't mind doing it wired. I prefer wired. Thank you. I never thought when I played this game uh alone in my bedroom, I never thought I would actually have people like watching and enjoying it years ago. That's kind of cool. That's kind of cool to be able to share to share a common interest with others. That's so neat. That's so neat. It would be even cooler if I went and got a PS5 controller. [Music] This one is old. You can tell. Oh, I like how you can tell the age on the music videos. Oh, this one is so old. This is like [Music] at least 10. [Applause] [Music] Loud [Music] la. [Music] [Music] beautiful.

It's fine. Maybe I'm out of stamina. [Music] Ah. Ah. God. Jesus. Dog. God. Stop dog. [Music] Uh but [Music] I'm refilling my blinking quota. out of my eyes. Drink something. You drink something. No, thank you. Uh, I don't have anything. I didn't prepare. I was busy trying to clear songs so that we didn't spend the whole time in hard mode today. Moisturize those eyes. Uh, I'm not going to do two more. Too many more. I think I am running out of stamina. My hands hurt. My musicum. Oh yeah. This song is evil. [Music] Dermatology. [Music] I don't know this song. I've never heard this song in my life. Da da da. [Music] Oh. Oh. Uhoh. Uh-oh. [Music] Oh no. Oh no. I thought I had a OBS errors. Oh god. [Music] Why are artists always so sad?

[Music] Lou around [Music] me too. [Music] I'm going to call it to Nigel if she can help me. She can. [Music] Hello. Hello. [Music] [Music] You know what I want to do? This would require uh Discord server unfortunately, but I want to watch you guys get into a ring and fight. [Music] I want to [Music] Oh, that was bad. Oh god. You 80 80 80 80 80 I want to watch you guys get into a ring and fight in the Meu world. I want to like it'd be funny to watch you guys do like a like a ranking. Get in the ring. We're playing We're playing dempa dempa dime. [Music] Your song is de paradime. Fight it out. Battle. Battle. It's time for a great battle. All right. What are we doing? Which one are we doing? We're doing one more. On hard. Yeah, you can do it on hard. No, you both have to be playing on the same. We start out on hard. No, we start out on normal and hard disappearance. That's also hard. I haven't unlocked that one. You find disappearance. The disappearance of Samos Shaba. [Music] Okay. If I do terrible on this one, then I'll do another one. Oh god. [Music] [Music] na- [Music] Sh [Music] [Music] nong [Music] nah. [Music] [Music] Why was I reading the lyrics? You're playing the game. What's wrong with me? [Music] [Music] We made it. It's fine. [Music] Yeah, this one is hard in hard mode because you're missing notes that your brain wants to play, but they're not there. And if you play them, it's going to time the under it's going to like make the other note not in time that you actually have to hit and then it's just going to be a mess. [Music] Yes, Twin, that was so good. Wait, why does everybody keep saying stop digging in your butt, Twin? Stop digging in your butt, Quinn. Where did that come from and why [Music] funny bum ah Ah, [Music] [Music] dancing. [Music] laing. [Music] will [Music] la. [Music] Ah, it's tricky. [Music] See, how are you supposed to know that's going to happen? [Music] I just should have done it like that. Why' I do that? [Music] [Music] I was like, "Oh, I know. I'll use one hand for this part." Immediately fumbles. Immediately eats it. Immediately fails. This song in karaoke is crazy. [Music] It's fine on hard mode. You haven't been using one hand. Uh well, sometimes sometimes [Music] I feel like this one's not that bad if I remember correctly. Oh jeez. Shield your fate. What am I talking about? Of course, this one is [Music] all right. All right, calm down. [Music] I have no macros for this one. I think I need specific macros for this. [Music] Oh god. [Music] Whatop? [Music] Oh no, I stopped reading the notes. Oh no, princess, stop. Oh god, it's fine. [Music] Yes. [Music] I'm so screwed. [Music] Oh jeez. [Music] Alive. Alive. Alive. Alive. [Music] [Music] No. Well, that's horrific. You can say that again, Bill. I don't know how fast that is. I can show you my macros if you want to see. They've changed the way you show macros in this game. I don't know if it's better or worse. [Music] You can't end on a loss. Look, it gets worse. This song gets worse. How I showed you my muckles, Blazers. How do I get to that menu? Um Let's pick a song that's not going to be really annoying. Customize. Maybe it's here. Game control config. Key config. Okay. Yeah, it's this. Oh, I lied. It's on the left button. It's on the buttons. Left button for triangle square X and then right button for square XO and then both on the triggers showing your macros like this. Yes. And I freehand the double notes. It's easiest to do it that way. Trust me, that's the easiest to do it that way. I wish I had the display working. Why did I do that? Why am I talk? Sh. Saba, please stop talking. [Music] My friend, [Music] I love the music video to this show, guys. [Music] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] Ah, chickn. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Applause] [Music] Bum bum bum bum bum bum. Get cupcake. [Music] Shoot. Shoot. [Music] Okay. Okay. My eyes are burning into my head. My eyes they burn. They are burning. Why you laughing at me? Why are you laughing at me? I have survived three and a half hours in a hot miku cinematic universe. All right. Do you know what three and a half hours of Vocaloid does to your brain? This is your brain on three and a half hours of a vocal. You can do better. I know. I don't tell me that cuz I will stay here until I do better. We're laughing with me. Ah, you're laugh. Yes. Ha. Haha. I know, but I played an hour and a half before trying to unlock the songs. I didn't even look at the There's like outfits, too. You can look at uh uh what's like a song we can leave this on. Oops. Wait. There's outfits. There's like characters. There's like all of this that I just ignored the entire stream today. I didn't even put a hat on Meiku. Wait, I have to do that now.

I think I've had enough hot Miku for today. Happy birthday, Miku. You can go back in the Steam library now until I download you again. 94% is bad. No, it's not. It's not. It's fine. Perfectly fine.

I'm excited. I'm going to play some PS3 games pretty soon. Um I don't know when they get to me. Couldn't tell you when they get to me, but I'm excited. PlayStation 3. Yeah, I'm thinking about starting Fable. I don't know. I still My September is pretty open. October is when it gets busy for me. So, I'll just I guess I'll just I don't know. We'll play it by ear and see what goes on in September. Yeah. What am I going to play in September? I don't know. The first Meiku 3 PS3. Meet I played Meiku on the PS3. I did. I bought it at GameStop. I bought pre-owned Hatsune Miku FC for the PlayStation 3. It was my first one. And the first the first song I played was uh Clover Club, I think. Clover Club. Yeah. GameStop pre-owned. Silk Song. I'm not sure I'll play Silk Song. I have never played uh the original game, but I'm excited. I'm excited for the Elder Ring. Elder Ring is getting a hard update. You guys see that? The night the night of terror. The night of horror. The horrible night of terror and horror. Yeah. Yeah. I'm excited. I'm excited. I'm excited. I'm ready. Whoa. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Okay, though. I'm going go. Have a lovely rest of your Have a nice start to your week. Have a nice Monday karaoke. I'm thinking about it. I've been singing to myself and I know that's when I've been quiet for too long. I need to have some therapeutic karaoke. I've been putting together an autumn set list. It might I might be doing like an autumn oldies just cuz I want to and like put like some static radio on and be like, "Hello, hello, hello, hello. Welcome. This is Radio Saba from the the 19 one of those. Yeah, this is so much fun. I I have like there's so much I can do that I actually end up finding myself having like choice is it choice paralysis? I can't decide and then I get panicked and then I go which is great. It's a great problem to run into. It's a fantastic problem to run into. Still a problem. What a great problem. Okay, guys. So, uh I will I will see you soon. Yes. Have a lovely rest of your weekend and a lovely start to your week. Happy Monday. Good luck at school. Good luck at work. Good luck at everything you are going to do. And I will see you next time. Bye. Goodbye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Wait. I could find music for you or you could listen to this. [Music] This. Okay. Bye-bye. [Music] Which one of you just said, "Look who decided to show up." Someone just said, "Well, look who decided to show up." As if this isn't my house. As if I don't live here. Well, lookie lookie who's here. Well, well, well. If it isn't the fish, dude, I live here. Yo, fellas. Fellas. Yo. Hey yo. I got scratchy voice again. Better than staring at the wall. What are we playing today? I'm so happy you asked. We're playing Facade. Facade. facade is older than possibly potentially quite a few of you here today. That's right. Created in 2005 or 2006, Facade was considered the future of gaming. 20 uh what is it 2025 right now? So that means that facade is 20 years old. Holy Facade is almost old enough to drink. Crazy. For those of you that are elderly, let me um Facade. Um I think Facade I remember like PewDiePie playing Facade. Facade. Uh Amnesia, those types of games. Yeah, I remember a long time ago. Not not at all. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, that means like YouTube is the same age as facade cuz wasn't the YouTube came out in like 2006 or 2005? So facade and YouTube.com are the same age. Oh my god, they're twins. But yeah, for those of you that are like, I don't know what this is. I think I think it's pretty much I think it's probably going to be pretty split. I think half of you are going to be like, I've never heard of this before. I have no idea what this is, but it said AI, so I'm interested. And the other half are probably there's probably a little bit of nostalgia for you. Uh whether you watch like PewDiePie or other other let's players play it oh 10 plus years ago. So, it's interesting. Also, I don't know why everybody keeps saying melons. I don't remember what there is like what I don't remember what melons have to do with this game. I have no memory. I watched the first like 2 minutes of the PewDiePie play through like an hour ago. Melons. Melons. All right. Hi. Why did I say it like that? Hi. I said it like I just spoke to you like I speak to my cat. Hi. Sorry. Um, okay. Wait. So, but wait, I wanted to uh I made a little bit of a list because Facade is a very short game. Um, I think Okay. Okay. So, the goal of facade um is we're going to be invited to these people's house and our goal is to last the night. It's like uh what came first? The alpha or the beta? It's like alpha five nights at Freddy's. Um Pad walked so Five Nights could run essentially. Um so our goal is to last the night before we get thrown out of the house. Um, so I think if you like pay close attention, uh, and we go in with like we lock in winning mindset, we could probably, uh, complete this in 20 minutes. But I'm not good at social interaction on the spot. So, we're probably going to get thrown out quite a few times. Uh, so if we manage to make it in the first go, I've made a list here of like role play we can do to mess with the uh to mess with the AI a little bit. Wait, is this even AI? Maybe this is like fake AI. Like how people call like the Pepper's ghost effect hologram when it's actually not a hologram. It's just really smart reflection. This is like that. So anyway, I made a list of some role play we can do. Um, so first one I have, we can go in like baseline raw. We could play the way the game is meant to be played. We get a little feel for it. Um, but then if that feels a little too like, oh, been there, done that. Um, ah, we have I have pizza man. We have to role play the pizza man. So we have to keep talking about pizza and and things that uh align with pizza like Teenage Ninja Turtles and Spider-Man. 2005. Both of those things existed in 2005, so we should be fine. Um, I also have I've just been in a car accident and I'm hemorrhaging, so I have to probably scream out in pain and repeatedly ask for a band-aid or ice pack or for them to like call emergency services. I think their names are Grace and Trip. It's her name is either Grace or Jane. I don't remember. hemorrhaging roleplay. Yes, car accident roleplay. I am the victim. I am um I have suffered heavy internal uh blunt damage and I am now hemorrhaging internally and I I need to see a doctor as fast as possible. Um what else do I have here? I'm the family dog. I can only say bark, grl, or lick. I can only like lick. So, we'll see how far that gets us. A doctor role play. Oh, I could pretend like one of them I've been I could pretend that the husband No, no, no. I can pretend that Grace called me in because she's suspicious that her husband might be a zombie. And we have to We have to get Trip to leave. I have to write that down. Trip Trip is a Wait, hold on. Great. Um, I'm like hazmat. I'm like toxic. What do they call them? The hazmat people. I'm like a hazmat guy. Grace called in the zombie squad. I don't know. Grace called Hback Serve Pro. The CDC. Huh? The CDC called the CDC. Me because she thinks Trip is a zombie. All right. What else do I have? Um, I have Grace is my wife and Trip is holding her hostage. And then I have Grace has to say the magic word. And I couldn't decide between yacht or boat. Uh yacht, boat, or divorce. You guys have any ideas for like a special code word? I want to make her say the code word or like giraffe or something like the zoo. Melon. Will she say melon? I don't think she would say yoho. She'll react. But I can't say the word. I can put melon. I don't know. I don't know anything about the melon. The meme word. Divorce or melon. Scrumptious. Delicious. Oh, what a fantastic day for some fresh, juicy water. All right, so pizza man. Uh, car accident and I'm hemorrhaging. I'm the family dog. Grace is called the CDC because she thinks Trip is a zombie. I'm the CDC. Grace is my wife and Trip is holding her hostage. Grace says the magic word, which is divorce or melon. I feel like we're just bullying Trip. Is that his I don't even know if that's his name. It might be his name. I don't know. Oh, by the way, the point of this game, not only is it to survive, but I think it's also we're supposed to fix the marriage. I I think we're supposed to fix we're supposed to help. I don't know if we're supposed to help or if we're just supposed to be a bystander. I don't I don't know. It's been a while. I don't know. Trip and Joanne. Is that Why does that sound familiar? So, yeah, we're marriage counselor. No, we're not. We're actually We're actually not. We're just We're just the bystander, maybe. I don't know. All right. Also, did you know that this game is old enough where that in order to replay, you have to actually close the entire game and launch it again? There is no replay, but Oh, there's a replay button, but when you hit replay, it just says you have to close the game and open it again. Ah, 2005. 2005. All right. So, first play. Let's just see like let's just get a feel for everything. Can I mumble anymore today? Jeez, guys. Sorry. Ancient tech baby. What was I doing? I'm opening the game. I'm opening the game. I'm opening the game. My favorite the Mumb that is literally just the color black. I'm so boring. I have no desktop image. Um where did I put it? Here it is. Okay, let's see. Give me. That's another I keep open. It's opening in compatibility mode. I'm running it as admin and it still just gives me like a buting so I don't know. So yeah, running as admin running in compatibility mode. I don't know. I had to follow like instructions on how to get this game to work cuz sometimes it just doesn't. It's 2005. I give it some wiggle room. It's fine. Uh, hey, it's Trip. Oh my god, that was a an answering machine, guys. It's been a while since since we all uh Hello. Hello. But uh you know, Grace and I thought it would be really really great to see you tonight. Uh for you to come over or something. Okay. Yeah. Uh, how about uh 8:00 or something? That that'd be uh that'd be really nice. Okay. Yeah. So, uh I really hope you can make it. Uh see you then. Yes. That was an answering machine. When when you had a house phone and and some and you trying to call somebody's house and not their their their cell phone, you would it would go beep similar to what you have on your cell phone, but it would ring throughout the house and then you would hear it over the house. Beep beep beep beep beep beep. Hi, you've heard you've reached. Yeah. Um my hands are full right now. I'm I'm double fisting uh Lay's potato chips and I I really am too greasy to get to the phone right now. But um I mean you could try calling back in about 5 minutes or so or you could leave a message if you want. Uh although to be honest, I'm probably not going to answer your call. Yeah, sorry. Um anyway, uh I have your number now. So I mean maybe you'll hear from me, maybe you won't. I don't know. All right. Thanks. Uh have a nice day. Uh okay. Bye. Uh, okay. Do I say bye or do you Okay, bye. Okay, thanks. Okay, bye. The chat is badly placed. Where where else am I supposed to put it? Where else am I supposed to put it, guys? Oh, please choose a name. I want to be called Bob because Bob we could continuously come back with different aliases like Richard or Dick. Put it under your chin. I think the chat is placed fine. I think this is a fantastic place. I think it's fine. I think it's beautiful. In fact, I think it's my favorite place. Gonzalo, let's see if my cursor is working. My cursor is not working. My cursor is broken. Oh, no, it's not. It's fine. Okay, check that out. Look at that, guys. That's a really old keyboard and a really old mouse and a really really old Holy moly. I bet you some some people played CS GO on stuff like this back in the day. I bet I bet some of your guys' first CS uh peripherals looked like this, didn't it? Huh? I bet it did. I Wait, didn't Steam come out in like 2005 or 2006? Steam's old too. No. 2008. Oh my god. It might be. This would have been CS Source. CS Source. Steam is older. Steam is 200 three. Oh my god. 2003. How many of you have an account for Steam that is like from 2003? If you don't mind uh outing your age, unless your parents made you a Steam account. Your parents were like, "We're going to set our kid up real well. We're going to get them a Steam account." Some of you do. That's impressive. Do you have like a like a number one number one guy badge? Yeah, I bet you do. Yeah, I bet you do. I bet you do. What else was I going to say? I don't remember. Anyway, okay, so those are our instructions. So, we type. Why am I yelling? Oh my god. We type to speak to the characters, which I have to remember. The controls are a little weird. We just type. You don't have to hit enter. You just have to hit You don't have to hit enter like to open up the text chat. You just you just start typing and we move with the arrow keys and then we interact with things. We pick up objects with the mouse. Wow. Typing. Yeah, I know. Careful. I'm going to bust out the hooked on phonics. That would be kind of fun to play. Hooked on phonics. Old old computer games that they used to feed you in like elementary school. That would be fun. Adam, Amy, Andrew, where's Bob? I know Bob is like first here on this list here. There it is. Bob. Okay, I want Bob. Bob. The Oregon Trail. I saw a video. Didn't they make they like remastered the Oregon Trail for the Wii, I think. Right. They made like a like an anniversary edition or so for the Oregon Trail. I thought about buying it to play it eventually, but it didn't look that good. It just was like driving the the the Oregon. It was just driving the the wagon in a straight line and nothing really happened. So Michael Bob. That's me. Bob. I don't know. But I did look into the Oregon Trail. The Oregon Trail. Dysentery happens. Yeah. Well, I want like a roleplay game where you actually are role playinging the Oregon Trail and like you can die actually. You actually you actually contract dysentery somehow like IRL. Wait, isn't dysentery just like really bad diarrhea? I always used dysentery as like my go-to funny illness like oh and then everybody got dysentery and died. But I'm pretty sure dysentery is just like a bad tummy ache. It's like diarrhea, but it's like Yeah, it's like extreme diarrhea. It's like boss level diarrhea. Like you probably could die from it. What's the other one? Dysentery. There's another one. I can't think of it. The plague. Anyway, let's play. I'm I'm avoiding it because I'm nervous because I'm so I'm I'm not going to know what to say. Okay, we're just feeling it out. We're feeling it now. Lombago. Lombago. Lombago. Uh, type the first letter. Scroll the arrow keys. Press enter. Okay, you guys are ready. Ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready.

That statement is not helpful. trip. There's nothing wrong with disagreeing in front of our friends. We're not disagreeing. How about order some pizza? Jesus. You know, ever since we got married, I can't help it. I'm forever buying new furniture and redecorating. I I really enjoy it. New messages. What? See, try to understand. Even after a full day's work designing magazine ads, Grace somehow finds time to decorate. I could never do this, but sometimes I want to start fresh and paint free form all over the walls with a big messy brush. Okay, I don't really like redecorating. Bob, now be honest with me. Agree that this room just does not work. Grace, come on. What are you talking about? It's horrific. Yeah. All day long at work, I design ads for stylish objects like this armwire. Straight out of a horror film. So, I just had to have this on. The worst I have ever was thinking. This is the worst I have ever seen. You got to understand. Grace loves expensive. She was totally spoiled growing up. You should see the inside of her parents house. I'm sure I can return most of this and try to start over again on this room. Really? Well, well, I was right.

They're just drinks, guys. All right. You know what, Bob? I need to ask you something. Grace, Trip, let me ask our guest. I think Trip is an alcoholic. Oh, Bob. Yes or no? Yes. Do you think it's wrong for one person in a marriage to listen too much to the other? Too much listening to trust your husband or wife too much. To rely on my hands now. Is that wrong? Yes or no? Monkeys. Look, don't bother answering. I don't need to hear it. God damn it. How can I be happy when you act this way, Trip? Huh? Are you miserable? Alcoholic. Yeah, go on. Go away.

Hideous. A little later after our friend. Hideous. Oh, okay. Hideous. So, yeah, I just bought this painting, but when I see it hanging here in this room, what is this? It looks to me like an amateur painted it. Hideous. Yeah. Was that another word? Collecting these little glass sculptures for a long time now. There's nothing wrong with them. But now when I look at them, they give me such a headache. What is this? Spider-Man. Grace. I'm sure I can return most of this and try to start over again on this room. Well, it's impressive. Even after a full day's work designing magazine ads, Grace somehow finds the time to decorate. I guess it's just the artist in me dying to get out. What else should we say? What do we say? Um, artist. Ah, yes. I've been waiting for someone to say that. Artist. What are you talking about, Trip? He is just being honest about my decorating, which I appreciate. No, but I'm just trying to be Don't worry about it. Decorating is just not your thing, that's all. Yeah. Who Who wears green and gray? Green and gray? How you? Um uh God, Brad, this isn't much fun for you, is it? What? You got Uno. What? Grace, come on. It's not helping things for me to say that they have disagree. We're not disagreeing. We're not Brad. I want you to look at this photo from our recent trip to Italy. Trip, maybe our friend. Just because you don't like it doesn't mean our friend won't. So, come on. I I want you to look at this. Okay, we'll give Trip some time. Why did I allow you? Come over here and sit on the couch with me. Grace, now Brad, in one word, what does this picture make you think of? Oh, please our friend on the spot like that. Grace wasn't with me when I took this picture. She was No, no, that's not it. Yeah, that's a fine answer. I like that. Yeah, wait a minute. You asked me what I think. Art is subjective. You're going to correct me? What? How about oppressive? How about Christ?

What? Is it okay to try to quote unquote improve your spouse even if you need that same improvement yourself? Yes or no? I don't know. Uh, look, you don't need to answer. I don't need to hear anymore. Oh, Grace. You think I'm some kind of shallow person obsessed with money that I don't love you? You think our marriage is all just a sham? Yeah, good. Go away. I can't see. I was told there was going to be pizza. Damn it, Drip. Um, I'll come for you. No, wait, please. What are you talking about? I wasn't talking about you. Trip is smelly. I can't.

See, Trip, was it really worth it to fly all the way to Italy so you could take that inane picture? Wait, wait, wait, wait. See, I just wanted us to spend some time together. Trip thinks carting me off to Europe will, how did you put it? Thaw me out a little bit. On second thought, I don't feel like sitting. Dog on the couch. Wait. See, Trip tricked me into going. You can bet on it. Well, well, Trip can get overly obsessed. Oh, no. Adam, I just realized. I'm sorry. What? I haven't gotten us drinks.

Favorite pastime is to get the blood alcohol content of his guests higher than his. Why don't I make us one of my new drink inventions? I call it Grace's inner soul. It's a mixture of Chardonnay bitters and lots of ice. Oh, Jesus. You don't want my invention? No, I do. Secret. Trip doesn't even like the taste of alcohol. I do. So, Adam, how does that sound? Adam, trip's getting a little right away. Maybe you just want some juice or a mineral water. Yeah. No, I'm going to make this drink for us. Our friend is here. We're going to enjoy ourselves. That's all there is to it. Grace, everybody loves my drink. Talking. Well, of course, Trip. After all, you got enough practice when you were a real bartender. What? Phil, in college, you were a bartender. Fair. How do you know about that? Oh, I know you were trying to keep it a big secret, but one time my friends and I went slumbing off campus to some crappy bar in the sticks and we saw you there. Oh, that's great. You're driving me insane. Come on, man. God, damn. Slumping it off campus. You hide things from me. You're so distant. You do. You hide things from me. Woof woof woof woof. Adam, I Huh? What are you saying to me? My godamn parents. I wish you would just be yourself. Ever since I've known you, you resist just being yourself. Okay. Yeah, I hear you. All right. Caring you off to Europe. Grace, I do one little thing wrong. And you're cold and distant. Just one thing wrong. That's all it takes. Nothing. I'm like a dog begging for a food. Adam, I'm going to ask you something. Trip Grace, let me ask our guest a question. Adam, yes or no? Give me this. Each person in a marriage is supposed to try really hard to be in sync with the other, right? Come on. Give me something. When you're married, to make it good, you need to always be positive and agreeable and together, right? Cry out loud. I don't know. Why don't you ask this magic aball? Look, you don't need to answer. I don't need to hear anymore. Look, it's obvious. We're not happy, Grace. I'm not happy. You're not happy. And no matter how much I try, I can't make us happy. I don't know what to do. God damn it. Yeah, good. Get out of my sight. I don't want to look at you. Oh god. What are you saying? What grace are you talking about? What do you care? Wait wait wait wait. Normally like this. I I don't know what's going on. Look. Maybe you Oh, no. Don't do that. God. What are you talking about? do care. Adam Trip is sometimes so we're talking about me again, are we? What? Grace, we don't we don't have to do this. Things are okay. We can just I can't stand the pretending anymore. I can't take it. No, Grace. We can I mean, come on. Don't make it out to be so bad. Wolf. Wolf. Adamof, if there's something about me, just tell me what it is. Arf, [ __ ] Arf. No, let's let's focus on us. Our relationship. It's so annoying, Grace. Why is it that anytime I want to do something nice for you, you resist it, trip? Like, I always have to convince you, Adam. You know, we back and quick, go in. You know what, Adam? That's it. You need to leave. No. There's only so much you can expect to put up with, you know. a wolf. We'll be fine. You should just go. Fine. Okay. Okay. Okay. There's there's objects that I want to interact with. Next. Okay. This time, this next next time we will we will humor him with a drink or we will use the magic eight ball. But we got so close to getting a drink. It's going to break things and I can't throw things, I don't think. Did I pee on the sofa as the dog? No. No. But we we escaped before they started yelling again, which is pretty nice. I You think I ruined him with the insults? Or could it be when I tried to kiss his wife like three times? Well, technically lick his wife. Lick his wife three times. That's worse. But I showed up in my fursuit. They knew what they were getting when they called me. Uh, hey, it's Trip. What a name. Trip. Me showing up in my first suit is worse. But well, at least they knew what they were getting, though. They knew what to expect. Adam, Greg, Heather, Jane, I'm a lady. I'll be a lady. Jane. Heather. I'll be Heather. Hi, my name's Heather. That should be all. My name's Heather and I want a drink. Oh, she's here. What? You told me to be an hour from now. Heather. Hey, it's been too long. How are you doing? Oh, yeah. The European style greeting. No, no, sure. If that's what you want to. Hi. How are you? Oh, it's so nice to see a Hi. about to say you look really good. So come in, make yourself at home. I'll close the door. Oh, Heather, take a look at this photo I just put up from our trip to Italy a couple of weeks ago. Okay, I'm going to hear him so hard. Here and sit on the couch with me. No, hold on now. How romantic. What does this picture make you? Right. Love romance. Well, I'm not going to bore you with the details, but it was a very romantic weekend, wasn't it, Grace? Oh my god. Well, it didn't take long for you two to bond or whatever. This game is so unbearable. It's okay. We'll get the alcohol. Help me understand where I went wrong with my new decorating. Grace. Oh, no. We don't need to do that. When I saw this armoire in the store, it seemed to have such a clean, simple look to it. Bar, but looking at it here in the apartment, it just looks like a monstrosity. Right, right, right, right. Oh, how nice. I've been waiting so long for someone to say that. Wait, what? Trip, our friend has just been refreshingly honest about my decorating, which I really appreciate. Okay. So, I'm sure Trip, if you can't see it, don't worry about it. You've never had an eye for these things. I So, you're not enjoying this, are you? What? You don't agree? Okay. I'm having so much fun. Grace, come on. It's not help. I love you. All right, good. Maybe you're on my side tonight after all. You're You know what? It's about time. So, I fix us some drinks. I know. When it comes to drinking, I have the simplest tastes. I'm scared to say anything. The best. Scared to say anything. I know. I'm going to open us a magnificent uh I mean astounding Bordeaux. Best of the best. You can't buy this in stores. Very very Trip. You are such a wine snob, just like my dad. I'll take that as a compliment. Heather, what do you say? No, no. I really think we should have this wine. Trust me. Trust me. Heather, maybe you'd like some juice or uh mineral water. Yeah. No, we need to open this wine. Our friend is here. We're going to enjoy ourselves. That's all there is to it. I've been dying to try this Bordeaux for a long time. This is the perfect opportunity. That's not the Bordeaux we were going to drink on our 10th wedding anniversary, right? Oops. Oh, you're driving me insane. Uh, no. I'm the one going insane. Please, a drink. Sometimes I feel like our whole marriage is just for show. I don't know how I really feel. Heather, can you believe this? Our anniversary wine you so desperately want. Heather, no. I'm not fixing you a drink right now. All right. You know what, Heather? I need to ask you something. Grace Trip, let me ask our guest a question. Heather, yes or no? In a marriage, shouldn't one person try to make their spouse a better person, even if they don't want it? Yes. What? What? Oh, okay. Sure. Oh, Grace. You think I'm some kind of shallow person obsessed with money, that I don't love you? You think our marriage is all just a sham? Yeah, good. Get away from me. You guys, please. Please, we can work this out. I'm going into desperation mode. Oh, girl, that's What are you talking about? I wasn't talking about you, Heather. I can't believe you have to see this. It's okay, Heather. Play therapist. Just be so Dog runway. Are we What? Grace, even though now you're a creative director at work, and even though you redecorate the apartment all the time, I didn't give them a reason enough. What do you mean, I'm sorry, you're not, Heather. I need all this stuff. Having all this money makes us so happy. We're so happy, aren't we, Trip? Jesus. What do you want? Now you're unhappy because we're too well off. Heather, isn't it? Isn't that ridiculous? Um, well, I mean, Grace, what do you want? Nothing. I want nothing. Why not? Let's continue focusing on Grace. Heather, look around this apartment. It's got everything anyone would ever want. But Grace, oh no, she's never satisfied. Trip. No. No. Ah, thank you. That helps him. Trip, look at my parents. If money bought happiness, they wouldn't hate themselves like they do. What? Look, let's talk about us both, not just one of us. Trip, you just pretend to like all this stuff. Fancy cigars and fine wine. You think I'm not good enough? never said that. I'm saying there's more to you than all this. Could be. Yes. Heather, thank you. That helps. Here, let me sit down. My legs hurt. I know that you like to hang out at that little sports bar on the corner. What? What? No. No. I I mean trip other boys. Oh god, this is so faking insane. Perhaps soon. This is too much. I can't take this. Let's get just one person. Grace, I I will take care of you. Trip. Dave. Dave. This is the part of the night where they stop listening to me. Trip. Heather. Do you love that? I know. Heather, you're you're saying I'm a I'm a loving person, Grace. You know, I've never wanted anyone but you. I don't know what to do, guys. No. I think they're No, Heather. I I I mean, no. I doubt it. Quick, guys, ask it a question. Will I eat pizza after the stream? This is the first time you've actually come out and said that, Trip. No. Will I Will I eat two pizzas after? Something about me. Just tell me what it is. Let's keep talking about Trip. Heather, it's time that Trip finally just admits that our marriage admits that our marriage is not Stop it, De. No pizza. Okay. What? Oh, God. Look, why don't we talk about us, our relationship? Trip, can't you see? It's the way you speak. The way you talk to me. What? It's our relationship. The way you tell me what to do. You don't listen. Heather, I'm not telling her what to do. Yeah. Can we have that drink now? Well, he told us no. He's like, I'm not pouring you a drink. Let's keep talking about us both, not just one of us. Yes. You know what's so annoying is when you pretend to be all romantic. What, Trip? It is such an act. Fake romance. Oh my god, Heather. What? A simple crazy. I'm not acting when I'm being romantic. God damn. Fake love. Heather, this is so Okay. I'm sick of this [ __ ] I'm Heather. I know what you're trying to hint about me. I'm uncomfortable marriage. No, Heather, this is awful. Hold on. Let me finish. No. No. You let me finish. Grace. Yes. Stop talking over me. Been paying close attention to what you've been saying. Both of you speak the [ __ ] Both of you. Shut up for two seconds. Makes me wonder if you're really my friend or not. Trip. Heather. I ask you this, yes or no? Do you really think that praising grace and worst of all saying I need to be more loving, but especially what you said about trying to change the other person? And you don't even say yes when I ask you if you want the truth. Are you asking me a question or all that is supposed to help me understand something about myself? Is what you said tonight supposed to add up somehow to something? All right, Grace. I've been having an affair. Oh my god. It's over now though. But how could you? I knew it. Barcelona. I knew it. Maria. Maria. Maria. I was lonely. Grace. Maria. But But I I regret it. I really really regret it. Maria trip. How could you? Oh my god. Wait, Heather. Grace, there's more. More. She's in the freezer. Where does he get his Grace? See, I'm ashamed of my parents. What? Your parents are great. He's pregnant. I love seeing them. I know. I know. But compared to yours, they're so ignorant. But they're real. I hate how my parents are pretending to try something hard to be like your family. But I feel like gloss over the last thing you said. I feel like I could never get rid of my past. What's your past? It's kind of like I don't know who I am anymore. Is he going to Wait, I don't like I don't I don't like this. Oh my god. What? Heather, what? This changes everything. Yes, that does change everything. He jumps through the window. There's a banisher there, right? I think it's over. Wait, Trip. What? No. Tell us about Maria. Don't you see that? What? I just told you something about us I should have said a long time ago. You think I'm phony for hating my parents and wishing they were like yours? And no, I I think you enough of that already. I think you you were you were having a you what about the Yes. I betrayed you. Yes, Trip. I No, Grace. This is about me and it's about us, but it it's not about you. Not about me. Hey, no. Wait, Heather, I'm sorry. You really helped me though, so thanks. Trip. Trip. Oh my god. I should have told him that. I that you what? I could have told him that. What? That you what? So there we're hiding something. Trip was having an affair with Maria. Wait. So, if we play again and we bring up Maria, can we name ourselves Maria? I have to see. We'll never know. Let's try. So, Trip is having an affair with Maria, which might explain why he's so outwardly angry all the time because he's so guilty. Was that a good ending? I have no idea. We're going to name ourselves Maria if we can. And if not, we're just going to we're just going to keep talking about Maria and see if it triggers his his little AI brain to talk about Maria. Are there any good endings? I don't know. Does anybody know how many endings there are? I think there's like six. It didn't look good. No, he sounded really he really ch like his voice is usually pretty chipper. Hey. Hey. What's up? Yeah. At the end. No, I was I was getting kind of worried because he sounded really like really sad like Yeah, sure. Seven endings. Maybe this time we'll get that drink. Ask him how's Maria. Well, if we can't be Maria, then I'll pretend to be. Maria's brother. Yeah, that's what we'll be. Okay. First, let's look for Maria. E F G H I J K L M Matt. Mary, Mark, Lisa.

They don't know black tie only from black bean chili. That's all. Bye, Travis. Mark, let me get you a drink. Ah, you need to help me break in my expensive new set of cocktail making accessories.

Yeah. No. Uh Merllo will be fine. That's That's fine. Grace, I know what you want, but I'll ask anyway. What would you like to drink? Um, just a glass of Chardonnay for me, please. Oh, Chardonnay. Sure thing. Cold and icy like your heart. Oh, God. Mark, I hope you didn't come here tonight to be entertained. What? Here you are, Grace. Your drink is ready. I came here think anyway. Grace, come on. It's not helping things for you to say that. There's been disagreeing in front of our disagree. We're not. Here you go. You two really are getting along well tonight. Oh, Mark, I thought you might like this photo I just put up from our recent trip to Italy. Uh, it's a beautiful picture of the Italian countryside. Of course he'll like it. Grace, I know you don't like it, but our friend might. Mark, come take a look. By the way, anybody join me on the couch if you like. Sorry. Um, now Mark, in one word, what does this picture say to you? Say to you? Yes. Good question. Good question. I need a stay behind in the hotel room when I was out taking this picture. So, I know your dirty secret. No, I just want one word. How about controlling? Maria. God. Romance. Now it says romance. Romance in our marriage. That's just a code word for manipulation. Grace, it'd been such a long time since we'd had a chance to. You planned that trip without even asking me if I wanted to go. Mark, that's not the first time he's done that. He was going to see Maria. Wait, you think Maria is having an affair, Grace? Oh, you're you're quite the kid tonight. Grace, he is not the man you think. Never afraid to say anything that pops into your mind, Maria. Yeah, hold on. Um, you know, ever since we got married, Trip is forever trying to get me to buy new furniture and decorate. And but Mark, you have to look at this room and admit it looks terrible. Grace, I mean, look around this room. He acknowledged it. He said the word. He does know the word. Say that. You know, at work, I waste all day designing ads for stylish objects like these paintings. And then it makes me think I want to design them into my apartment. Grace was the highest bidder at an auction for this. But damn it, no, I'm wrong. They look completely amateurish and tacky. Not coming together. What? Maybe we should ask Maria. What? Grace, everything's fine. No one is complaining about your decorating. Silence. There must be some way I could trip. I don't know what to think. I don't know. You're good at decorating. Trust yourself. Hey, that wasn't nice of him to say. You're driving me insane. Uh, no. I'm the one going insane. Goddamn romance trip. Our whole marriage. You're so I better sit down.

What are you saying? with a woman named Godamn explanation Maria. You're never satisfied with Look, you're going to really make it bad if you keep criticizing me. Okay, you know what, Mark? I'm going to ask you something. Grace Trip, let me ask our guest a question. Mark, yes or no? Do you think it's wrong for one person in a marriage to listen too much to the other? Listen too much? To trust your husband or wife too much? To rely on them too much? That's called codependency. Yes or no? Yes. What? Okay. See, I keep trying to help you, Grace, but you reject me. You cut me off. You cut me out of your life. God damn it. Oh yeah. Good. Go away. I can't stand you. God damn it. Can I have more? Can I have more? More? Will I get some more? I'm sorry. This is a disaster. It's okay. He is. Look, you probably just want to leave. Grace, I love you. What? I can't hear you. I'm Oh, no. What are you doing, Grace? Are you talking about me? I wasn't talking about you, Mark. Grace is sometimes so Oh, so we're talking about me, are we? What?

See, Mark, I've been listening carefully to what you've been saying tonight. You've really been pushing me. Yes. It makes me wonder if you're really my friend. Great. Lamar, I've got to ask you yes or no. Oh, she's hard to correct. Do you really think that flirting with flirting with Trip, telling me I'm afraid, and worst of all, suggesting that I'm cheating on Trip, especially what you said about listening too much to your spouse, that it's all supposed to help me understand something about myself. Is all of that arguing intended to mean something, or is it? I just want a yes or a no. Okay, Trip. Through our whole marriage, I've let you dominate me. Oh, what? My As a kid, my parents took care of everything. Bought me whatever I wanted. Made decisions for me. But grace trip, I've used you and our apartment full of expensive crap to hide to avoid responsibility for myself. Come on. I can't avoid growing up forever. Trip, maybe she's not though. You are cheating. Jesus. Who is he? Jesus. What is his name? Are you changes everything? And no, Mark, hold on. Yes, it does change everything. She is. Don't you leave this room. I think it's over. I'm closing the door. Grace, no. It's over, Trip. Don't you see that? What? You just told I just told you something about me I should have said a long time ago. From the beginning, I've let you She's not going to listen to me anymore. Mark, please. It's okay, Grace. No. I We No, Trip. This is about me. I see now it's not about you or about our marriage. Me? are married. Hey, no, wait, Mark. I'm sorry, but thank you. You You really helped me. Grace. Grace. Jesus Christ. I should have told her that. I could have told her that. Yeah, I win. I can't tell if she's hiding something. I can't I can't tell if if she really she's cuz she keeps bringing it up. She She's like, "Oh, you're you're you're accusing me of cheating. Was she deflecting? Was she deflecting and dodging?" I can't I can't tell. Or it might be only Maybe it is only Trip. I saw a town. Hi. She mentioned earlier she me she mentioned Maria earlier. She I don't know she cheated past tense. Do I have to use past tense too as well? Okay, I want to try again, but we're going to use the past tense. So, he Wait, was he currently or he was also past? Are they both having an affair with the same Maria? Maybe. He says he ended it. Okay. You think Trip forced her to marry him? She said he she but but she said she was using him. She said, "Oh, I'm using you and your fancy apartment and and all your nice things." So, Trip, I guess, makes a lot of money and she's using him. It's Mar Maria and Mario. Ah, she wants to impress her parents, right? Yes. Yes. Yes. They both have a lot of baggage. That's true. Oh, yeah. Grace is like, "You're you're I let you dominate me. You're so dominating, Trip. Ask about their pets. I don't think they have any pets. How do we How do we get more information? How do I get more information? Do you guys have tips how I get more information? Don't take any clear side. Ask yes or no questions. Okay. She's afraid of something. But I thought she was afraid of maybe leaving. maybe afraid of leaving the relationship because she would have to be honest with herself and her her lackluster art career. I type Matt Damon a lot. What does Matt Damon have to do with this? It's freaking Matt Damon. Help me help you. She's afraid of the truth. Tell Grace she needs to grow up. He could Matt Damon. Holy crap, Lois. It's Matt Damon. What is Grace afraid of? Sometimes they ignore That's true. They just like flat out ignore me a lot of the time and they'll just start yelling at me and then I feel like Jesse at the dinner table in that one episode of Breaking Bad where it's just like really awkward and he's you know that just it's that I'm just sitting there shaking my magic eightball waiting for somebody to actually listen to me or for everybody to stop yelling. Either or. Oh, they reacted to Wait, wait, maybe I can go in and just be a little a little scuzzball cuz they also reacted pretty heavily to me. Like Trip was a Well, Trip Trip called me control your libido, you cuz I said I know his dirty little secret, which we do. We know his dirty little secret is that he's had a a long relationship with Maria cuz I said dirty. Wait, will they respond differently if I have a Audrey Beth? I'm an old woman. Oh, I forgot subtitles. I'm sorry. Shoot. Where are the new wine glasses? Dirty little secrets. Maria sends her regards. Jesus. Maria's regard. What? I'm going to pretend to be Maria. Trip. It's me, Maria Beth. Hey, I thought I heard someone out here. God, it's been so long since we've seen Hi. Um, well, come on in. Uh, I'll uh I'll go get Grace. Grace? What if I call them like bad boy? You've been a bad boy. You've been a bad girl. I'm gonna Yeah. No, wait. Quick, hurry. Do we focus on Grace or do we focus on Trip? Because Trip, we already know, but Trip, I want I maybe I'll do both. I can't decide. Gain their trust. Beth, hi. How are you? Oh, it's so nice to see you. It feels like it's been focus. Okay. Yes. By the way, you look fabulous. Yes. Well, come on in. Make yourself at home. I will sit. Oh, Beth, take a look. Oh, I'll get it. No, no, no, no. Our our friends here. We can let the answering machine get it. Say yes. No. And one of your art gallery friends. It seems like they're always calling you. Well, hold on. Anyhow, there's my new fabulous home of Grace and Trip. Leave us a message. My parents aren't worth talking about. Travis where I haven't heard from you and Grace in a while. I'm just calling to find out if you're settled in in your new apartment. That's all. Let's not do that. Give me a call if you're not traveling. I know you're traveling a lot these days. Know everybody says the view from our balcony is fantastic. Yeah, it really makes you feel like you've made it, but I'd some trees or something. A natural green would enhance the colors of the room so much. Travis, was that Maria? Well, it's impressive. Even after a full day's work designing magazine ads, Grace somehow finds the time to decorate. Oh, okay. Trip is the artist in me dying to go. Okay. Trip is his nickname. Travis is his full name. That's weird. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Um Um Um Um. Who is our gallery friend? Really? See, Grace, you're the only one unhappy with your decorating. Oh, well, I guess I'm wrong then. Thanks for clearing that up. Where's my drink? Huh? I think I drink to get along. I'm going to fix us some drink. You'll be the first to sample from my new set of imported drinking glasses. What would you like? How about a martini? I just got a hold of this rare imported Icelandic vermouth I want you to try. Please, let's not go overboard. Diet doctor, get help. Vermoose. What is ver vermouth? What is that? Is that like uh Well, you know what? I'm just going to make you a martini. No. No. Beth, maybe you'd like some juice or mineral water. What? Um, okay. Okay, good. No, no, that's fine. That's fine. I'll just make something nice for myself. Grace, maybe at least you'll drink with me. I'll make us something real nice. Light on the alcohol. What do you say? I'm going to join our friend in what she is having. Wait. Okay, fine. No. Okay, Beth, what did she drink last time? Are you What? Listen to us. We're arguing and I thought there was I thought she was like, "All right, Grace, you Never mind. Never mind. Never mind." Okay. Thank you. Anyway, Grace, come on. That kind of statement is not helpful. Trip, there's nothing wrong with dis in front of our friends. Okay. Oh, what's that? Jesus. Here's yours. It's good. Okay. You and I are getting along better tonight than I first. What is this, Beth? I thought you might like this photo I just put up from our recent trip to Italy. It's a beautiful picture of the Italian countryside. Of course, she'll like it. Grace, I know you don't like it, but our friend might. Beth, come take a look at this. God, this evening is getting more exhilarating by the minute. Okay, play un play unbiased. Unbiased. Who is the art? This is making you uncomfortable. See, trip, was it really worth it to fly all the way to Italy so you could take that? Oh, let's not talk about my decorating anymore. I'm redoing the room this week. That's all there is to it. Trip thinks carting me off to Europe. Well, how did you put it? Thaw me out a little bit. Who? You're driving me insane. Uh, no. I'm the one going insane. Thaw me out. Trip, you think you are so romantic, but no, you're trying to manipulate me. Beth, can you believe this? Um, th me out. trip our whole marriage. You're so controlling say I'm go sit down again. All right. You know what, Beth? I'm going to ask you something. Grace, try to let me ask our guest a question. Beth, yes. Yes or no? Do you think it's wrong for one person in a marriage to listen too much to the other? What? To trust your husband or or wife too much? To rely on them too much? Is that wrong? Yes or no? What? Oh, yes. That's fine. That's fine. God damn it. How can I be happy when you act this way, Trip? Huh? I'm miserable. Yeah. Go on. Get away from me. Can I ask him if Grace is cheating on him? I just want to know. I want answers. Should I ask? Stay neutral. Um, who is the art? What? What are you saying? What are you talking to? I was not talking to you, Beth. Aha. Beth, you're saying I'm loving? You know, Trip is always the wrong guy. Some kind of cold, distant person, but I'm not. See, the thing is, it just depends on who I'm with. Let's talk some more about Grace. Beth, it's time that Trip finally just admits that our marriage admits that our marriage is not Stop it. Drama. Who? Thank you. Just saying that helps me. See, this this is how it's been for the past 10 years. 10 years. No, let's let's focus on us, our relationship. You know what's so annoying is when you pretend to be all romantic. What? Trip, it is such an act. Oh my god, Beth. What? Oh. Um, okay. Okay. Okay. What do I say? 10 years of what? Let's talk some more about us. Our relationship. Trip. Can't you see? It's the way you speak. The way you talk to me. What? I'm not allowed to be angry. You tell me what to do. You don't listen. Beth, I'm not telling her what to do. I'm trying to help her. 10 years of what? 10 years of who? You just pretend to like all this stuff. Fancy cigars and fine wine. You think I'm not good enough. I never said that. I'm saying there's more to you than all this. Could it be that she doesn't like him? Are you happier with someone? Shoot. Ask a yes or no question. Are you happy with trip? Ah, Beth, you're saying I'm depressed. Sometimes I feel like things just Well, maybe. Life is passing me by. Grace, come on. Look around. We've got a great life. Oh, yes. With our new biscotti oven, how could I possibly want Is there someone else? Yeah, life is passing me by. Give me a break. What? I I I just Let's continue focusing on Grace. Do I smell? Look around this apartment. It's got everything anyone would ever want. But Grace, oh no, she's never satisfied. Trip, I'm so sick of this. Um, well, I mean, we've got everything. Trip, you just don't. Beth, if there's something about me, just tell me what it is. It's not you. We need to talk about us both, not just one. I think Trip's afraid of visiting his parents. He does everything he can to avoid. No, she's not. My parents. My parents are idiots. Who calls the phone? Uh, art gallery friend cheating. Ah. Oh god. What is this? Is making no sense. What? What? What is this? I'm confused. No, no, no, no, no. Our our friend is just trying to to confuse me or something. Ah, what are you trying to say? I might not love Trip. What? Oh, God. I Is that Is that what you think is happening here? That's That's That's what you think. What? Did I come on too strong? Uh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Oh god. Be I'm going to cry. This is bad. I mean, they're there. They're there. Let's keep talking about us, our relationship, you know. I I really don't have anyone to talk to. Grace, my so-called friends, they're just jealous of us, if you can believe that. Beth, we Beth, we already talked about that. Am I wrong? Yes, you are wrong. Now, shut up. Shut up and sit in the corner, Travis boy. Let's keep our focus on Grace. Grace, even though now you're a creative director at work and even though you redecorate the apartment all the truth is you're not say his name in chat. I'm sorry. You're not Beth. Beth, you see this is what I've had to put up with for 10 goddamn years. Look, let's not focus on just me or you. Let's talk about us both. Beth, you think this is all my fault, don't you? See, you lied to me from the moment we got married. Insisted I'd be better off in advertising than art. Ask about who's Vince. Jesus. Grace. Beth. Do you agree with that? Who's Vince? Beth, we already talked about that. No, we didn't. Shut up. Shut up. Uh, okay. Stop. I I I can't do this anymore. Godamn it. Beth, I know what you're trying to hint at about me. Say about our lifestyle. Do you two want to hear the honest truth? Huh? Beth, are you ready for that? Yes, please, woman. Yes. Beth, say something. Yes. Beth, I've actually been paying close attention to what you've been saying tonight. You've really been pushing me, and I wonder, are are you really my friend? I don't care. Beth, come on. Yes or no? Do you really think that telling me I'm depressed? And first of all, saying I need to be more loving. And what you said about listening too much to your spouse, that I'm supposed to realize something about myself from all that. Is what you've said tonight somehow to something? Is it? I just want a yes or a no. Oh, wait. I wasn't listening. What did she say? This is not a trick question. Um, no. No. Oh, I'm surprised. I would have said yes. It did mean something. I didn't say anything. You put words in my mouth. But that's fine. Trip. Through our whole marriage. Let me dominate you. I'll let you dominate me. Shut up and ask to answer me. Dominate you? As a kid, my parents took care of everything. Bought me whatever I wanted. gallery friend made decisions for me. Dirty but grace and our apartment full of expensive crap to hide to avoid responsibility for myself. No, I can't avoid growing up forever. trip. Jesus. Jesus. Beth. Hi. What? What?

Don't you see that? What? But you I just told you something about me I should have said a long time ago. From the beginning. I've let you control me. And No, Beth. Please. It's okay. Grace, no. I No, Trip. This is about me. They don't care. No, it's not about you or about our marriage. I could spontaneously combust and they wouldn't care anymore. I'm just going to let them whatever. Why? But thank you. You you really helped me. Grace. Grace. I don't think she is. Although, I can't get over the the the the friend. Like, she sounds like she is, but I should have told her that. Maybe she's not. I could have told her that. Yeah, she was she was dropping crazy uh hints, but I don't know what did he need to tell her. I don't know. Can we get them to drink a lot? I don't know. Cuz Grace doesn't want to. Say nothing this time and just let them yell. What? They've been doing that already. I could have stepped out of the room and they probably would have just continued without me there. What if I just flirt the whole time? I could do that. Let's change it up a little bit. Although, maybe they'll throw me out. I don't know. I feel like they might throw me out. Don't let them talk. Don't let them call yourself Vince. Is that what the name is of the Is that Gracism? secret boyfriend. Bring up his parents. Subtitles. The fish. Rizzler. The friler. his wife's boyfriend. Tell them both what they want to hear. I can't I don't know if I can do that cuz no matter what, if I agree with one, the other's going to be like, "Oh, well, you you will is the last name." I like Warren. Warren makes me sound like an old man. We got to balance it. Okay. The new wine glasses. That should be obvious. Oh, God. Trip. Don't turn this into a big Jesus. Come on. I'm not asking a lot here. Oh, he's here. Did I skip over Walter? That would have been funny. Walter. Walter. Hey, how you doing? Long time since we've seen you. How you doing, man? Hey, big man. Great. All right. Wow. It's really, really great to see you. Well, come on in. Hey, handsome. Yeah, come in. Uh, let me go get Grace. Grace? No. No. Here we are. Warren. Warren. Hi, how are you?

Oh, I'm going to fix us some drinks. You'll be the first to sample from my new set of imported drinking glasses. I've got the perfect bottle of Cabernet I've been saving for just such an occasion. We went wine tasting last year in the Napa with Grace's parents and discovered this stuff. It's exquisite. You and your high class. Wow, that sounds incredible. Perfect. No, no, Warren. Maybe you'd like just a simple glass of white. Oh, sure. Beautiful. Okay, Trip. You heard him. All right. All right. We can indulge in my new cocktail. A wristler. Grace, I assume you also don't want a real drink. Correct. I'm not in the mood to drink tonight. Just cranberry juice for me. Oh, fancy. Warren, seeing you again makes me remember the wonderful times we all used to have. You are unforgettable, darling. Here you are, Grace. Your drink is ready. He hates me. He hates me. He wants to kill me. He wants to throw that glass at my face. He hates me. Warren, if I didn't know you better, I'd say you were flirting with me. Nah, I guess that drink is already hitting you. I haven't had any drink anyway. Here you go. Whoa, I just realized something. What? We have to celebrate. Tonight's a special night. What do you mean, Warren? Remember it was almost exactly 10 years ago tonight that you introduced us senior year of college. We really want to thank you for years and years of pain. Hi. Whoa. Love. Beautiful love. Yeah. Yeah. It's great that you could be here tonight. Well, we're all friends here. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. No. Wait. What's wrong, Trip? Trip, there's nothing wrong with disagreeing in front of our disagreeing. We're not disagreeing. Hey, now let's just all We're not spread love. You know, ever since we got married, Trip is forever trying to get me to buy new furniture and redecorate. And And it's I kind of enjoy it. It's great. Everybody loves it when they come in and see our latest decoration scheme. But Warren, you have to look at this room and admit it looks terrible. Grace, I mean, look around. This room is It's hideous. Grace, no. No, don't say that. It's be beautiful like you are. Ah, yeah. Warren, I knew you'd like it. See, Grace, you don't realize how good all this looks and You Oh, no. This arm war is such a monstrosity, isn't it? No. What? Aha. I knew it. I was right, Grace. You're the only one happy with your decorating. No, decorating. Oh, well. Oh, that's nice of you to say. Grace, aren't you glad we invited him over? You are a You should stick with very lucky man trip. Yeah. No, see, she never listens. Is this a orange juice? Warren, I thought you might like this photo I just put up from our recent trip to Italy. It's a beautiful picture of the Italian countryside. Of course, he'll like it. Grace, I know you don't like it, but our friend a photo of Grace. Oh, you'll never guess where I took that picture. Is this really something you want to brag about, trip? Let's tell you about it in a sec. Men have Come take a look at this. God, this evening is getting more exhilarating. Pineapple juice. Yummy. Wait, what was I going to say? Warren, this is making you uncomfortable. See, trip, was it really worth it to fly all the way to Italy so you could take that inane picture? Grace, I'll take the picture done later tonight before I go to bed. Warren, that's mean to be our second home. He likes the photo. Is that what it was? Huh? I'm always the last to know. Grace, I wanted us to spend some time together. Oh, I didn't think you cared to hear about our Italy trip. Well, I won't if you take attitude. You're driving me insane. Godamn Italy. I try to reach out to you. I try to be romantic with you, but you're cold and distant. I do. I really try. Mhm. Warren, can you believe this? Oh, yeah. You I know what you're about to say. The way you keep talking about Italy. Damn. I'm going to I can't comfort her. I have a drink in my hand. The only one I'm happy. You don't think I could cut it as an artist, do you? I know it. You don't think I can. No. Please don't take sides. It's going to do more harm than good. Okay. Manipulation. Grace. I just want to be together and be happy. Can you just see that? Can't we just do that? All right. You know what? What do I do? I'm going to ask you something. Trip. Grace, let me ask our guest a question. Guys, take his side, Warren. Yes or no? If one person in a marriage gives the other advice and and that advice is taken years later, can you be blamed for that? What? Why is it okay to get blamed for giving advice that was taken like 10 years ago? Yes or no? Context is very important. Look, you don't need to answer. I don't need to hear anymore. I keep trying to help you, Grace, but you reject me. You cut me off. You cut me out of your life. God damn it. Oh, yeah. Good. Go away. I don't want to look at you. Oh, God. Stop running from me. No, don't. Please. Grace, are you talking about me? I'm not talking to you. Sorry, Warren. We're not normally like this. I I don't know what's going on. It's okay, baby girl. Warren, in what you said before about marriage, I think that tells us something about Trip. So, we're talking about me, are we? What? Grace, even though now you're a creative director at work, and even though you redecorate the apartment all the time, the truth is you're not an artist. I'm sorry, you're not. Warren. Hey, don't talk to pretty lady like that can't fit in. Warren, you see, this is what I've had to put up with for 10 goddamn years. What do I say? Stay neutral. Warren, there's something about me.

This room is The room is depressing. No, no, don't say that. The room looks like a dark, you know, at work, I waste all day designing ads for apartments with perfect views like this, and then it makes me think I want to design it into my apartment. This view makes me feel like a million bucks. But damn it, I'm wrong. I simply want a view of trees and green trees. What trees? E nature. Grace, everything's fine. No one is complaining about your decorating. ating is just there must be some way I could. What? Chica, what? Imagine she just comes out and says it now that she's cheating. Grace, listen to me. People like your decorating. You're the only one who feels this way. I don't know what to think. I I don't know. You're good at decorating. Trust yourself. Oh.

What are you doing? Senior year of college. I got on one knee in front of everybody. Stop it. Trip. I pulled out a diamond ring. Trip. And I said, "Grace, will you marry me?" Is that romantic or what? Adam. Yes. Very romant. Thank you. Sorry. I just It's not everyone thinks being proposed to like that is so romantic. I don't know where you get your ideas. Grace, come on. What could be more romantic than that? Grace. Adam, I'm sorry. You didn't mean to see that. Speaks. Trip. You're being a real boring night. Let's just forget about it, okay? You know, ever since we got married, I can't help it. I'm forever buying new furniture and redecorating. I I really enjoy it. Yeah, it's these people need more hobbies. You grew up with this stuff. Adam, now be honest with me. Agree that this room just does not work. Grace, come on. What are you talking about? Right, right, Adam. Of course you like it. See, Grace, you have no reason to complain. There's just nothing to complain about. So, I just had to have these sculptures. But now I can't take the sight of them. They're revolting. Oh, come on. Jesus. Why can't you just be happy with them? They're fine. Hello, Grace. Everything's fine. No one is complaining about your decorating. No, he is just being courteous. This room is not Grace. Come on, people. I only want me to go into advertising. I could have painted that painting on the wall instead of buying it. You're never happy. No one has a problem with your decorating but you. Oh my god, I almost passed out. I held my breath for too long. Anyway, why did I do that? Adam, I just realized that's right. That's me. I'm sorry. I'm Adam. I haven't gotten us drinks. Oh god. Oh, and please, please, I need us to break in my new expensive set of cocktail making accessories. My dad bought Trip a silverplated cocktail shaker for Christmas a few years ago. Make us one of my new drink inventions. I call it Grace's inner soul. It's a mixture of Chardonnay, bitters, and lots of ice. And you're in. It's a secret. Trip doesn't even like the taste of alcohol. Who knows? What? So, Adam, how does that sound? Wait. You You don't want my invention, Adam? Trip's getting a little carried away. Maybe you just want some juice or a mineral water. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Yeah. No, I'm going to make this drink for us. Our friend is here. We're going to enjoy oursel. That's all there is to it. Grace, everybody loves my drinks. You know that, don't you? Everybody. Just like how they liked your proposal, right? Of course, Trip. After all, you got enough practice when you were a real bartender. What? In with Maria. How do you know about that? Oh, I know you were trying to keep it a big secret, but time my friends and I went slumbming off campus to some crap bar in the sticks and we saw you there. Oh, that's great. You're driving me insane. He was dancing on the tabletops wearing nothing but a pair of tiny tiny shorts. You hide things from me. You're so distant. You do. You hide things from me. Oh, maybe I should have asked her that previously. Like, what are you hiding? Can you believe this? Oh, yeah. You I know what you're about to say. Negative tonight. I'm what? No. Why'd he call me parents? I wish you would just be yourself. Ever since I've known you, you resist being yourself. Romance. Damn it. Why didn't I turn on subtitles? I'm negative. Oh, you trying to say we've got problems or I've got problems. That this is all my fault from the start. Is that what you think? Wait, was that a question for me? You know what, Adam? Yes. I need to ask you something. Here we go, boys. Trip. Let me ask our guest. Here we go. Adam. Yes. Yes or no? Yes. Should a married person be allowed to flirt with other people for fun? What? I mean, if you're married, is it okay to do any more flirting, even if it's harmless? Yes or no? What? Hey, lady. Oh, yes. That's fine. That's I'm just answering. I'm just answering the eight the magic eight. The real truth is trip. You flirt with everybody. The clients at work, our friends, everybody. You can't help yourself. You're always looking around our entire marriage. God damn it. Yeah. Go on. Get away from me. I'm just the messenger. What the god damn it. My ball. My balls are talking. My ball's talking. Adam, I can't believe this is happening. Who knows? Look, you probably want to get out of here. No, this is fine. Jeez, what are you trying to talk to me? I'm not. I'm waiting for my Yes or no? just be so Oh, we're talking about me, are we? What? Trip, it's your fault. 10 years ago, freshly married and just out of college, you convinced me to go into advertising instead of art. Everything happened for you. I could be a real artist by now. The magic. Ask the magic, boys and girls. What answers will you discover? No, we need we need to talk about us both, not just one. I get so upset when I think about it. God, I regret it so much. What? Why did I let you convince me to give up painting? Oh, Christ. Adam, what? Hail the magic card. Let's keep talking about us both, not just once. We What makes me the most angry, Trip, is what you took away from me. What? I wasted 10 years in this marriage making advertisements and redecorating our apartment. Adam, wait. Am I supposed to say more? Never. Wait, Adam, you think this is all my fault, don't you? Uhoh. See, you lied to me from the moment we got married. Insisted I'd be better off in advertising than art. What? Oh, yes. Adam, you think I'm lying? Uh-oh. You does anyone? He's going to be like Malia again when I was old news. No, I want us to focus on Trip. Grace, you know, I've never wanted anyone but you. No. No. No. Adam. Yeah. I I mean, no. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. True thing. Yes. Well, this is the first time you've actually come out and said that trip. Adam, what is there something I should do? Let's continue focusing on Trip. Maybe later. It's time that Trip finally just admits that our marriage admits that our marriage not Stop it. Why am I Why? Thank you. No, I said why. Saying that helps me. See, this this is how it's been for the past 10 years. Look, why don't we talk about us? Our relationship. Trip, can't you see? It's the way you speak. The way you talk to me. What? I'm not allowed to be angry. You tell me what to do. You don't listen. Adam, I'm not telling her what to do. I'm trying to help her. Yes. See, I'm the one trying to reach out to you, Grace. Wait, is this the is this Let's talk some more about us. Our relationship genuinely so annoying, Grace. Why is it that anytime I want to do something nice for you, you resist it? Trip. Like I always have to convince you, Adam. I guess this is pretty neutral. Uh, what do I say? Nobody said anything. I can't say Grace never acts loving towards me. Okay. Yes. She's all over me at our goddamn parties trying to look good in front of the guests. Yes. Ah, thank you. Just saying that helps us. Oh, no. Sure thing. Sounds kind of like it's acting is the only reason I like parties. Uhhuh. Okay. I'm sick of this [ __ ] Was he swearing so much before? I know what you're trying to hint at. Do you about me? I don't. Do you really want the truth? Huh? Here it is again. Who knows why? Are you ready to hear it? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Grace. Huh? Yes. Adam, what? See, I've actually been paying close attention to what you've been saying. You've been really pushing me tonight. And I wonder, are you really my friend or not? Trip. Yes. Adam, come on. Yes or no? Do you really think that? And what you said about harmless flirting and you don't even say yes when I ask you if you want the truth? I didn't say that. Supposed to help me understand something about that was your wife. What you said tonight supposed to add up somehow to something. Hey man. Hey. Hey. Is it? I just want to know. Okay. That was your wife that said that. Adam, we're we're actually fine. Everything's No. Are you? Yeah. Yeah. No. Why not? I think it's it's okay if if you if you need to go. You know, Adam, nothing's changed. We're fine. We'll see you out. And there's no need to disagree or criticize us anymore. We're fine. Come on. Thank you for coming. There's nothing else to say tonight. No, no more need to be nice. Okay, now no. Look, we'll uh we'll see you later. or whatever. Or whatever. They don't like me. They don't want me around anymore. Adam, we'll see you later. Okay. Come on, Adam. Just go, please. Hug me. Okay, Adam, I think this evening is over. You've got to leave. We'll be fine. You should just go. Well, the eightball got us the engagement story. That was a little bit different, but in the end, we couldn't crack the case. There was like what? Two more endings that were missing somehow. Another two. We got We got I keep forgetting his name. We got Trip to confess that he was having an affair with a woman named Maria. And honestly, 100% Grace is hiding something. Oh, yeah. Trip's name is Travis, too. No, Grace. I think Grace definitely is hiding something. I just I don't know how to get it out of her. How did we get it out of I'd have to like go back and watch watch the VOD. How do we get the information out of Trip? Is this a mystery game? Um, I guess kind of. But yeah. Um, I think I'm going to I'm going to stop there. I think I've had my fill of this game. What about you guys? I just want to know the answer. Yeah, she said she was using him. She said that there's like gallery art friends. She said that she's just been awkward about everything and how how she asked like point blank, do you think it's fine to flirt with others? Well, while you're married, you have to side with her more. Oh, like we were pretty accusatory with Trip. Maybe with um Grace, you kind of have to be like she seems more Yeah. Okay. You have to be more You have to be not accusatory, but gentle maybe. I don't know. Ring. Okay, though that's that was facade. That was the good old classic facade. I have an announcement. No, no, not today. No announcement today. Not today. Yeah, that's a fun game. I like that game. I'm going to go I'm going to go look up how to get the other information out. How to get the how to get the real info out. How to get all the endings. Can you make them both fall in love with you and then you all three go onto a nice trip to Italy? Not today. Correct. Not today. Perhaps another day. Can you give me the funny face and the sound? What is that? What does that mean? What does that mean? That's crazy that the game is from 2005. Right. Right. I've been I' I've seen discussion here and there about how crazy it would be if they remade the game with today's technology and today's like I don't know that would be crazy. That'd be so crazy. That would be insane. Facade remastered except they have to call it V like that horror game. Vis. I want to get my water park to a five still. Um, I've been thinking about it. My water park. One more eight hour stream of freaking water park game. The water park game. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, we could play Bully, too. I have so I don't know. I got so many games. I'm just kind of chilling, you know? Chilling. I don't want to. I mean, I guess Water Park is a series game. And we did start Devil May Cry 3 again, so we could always go back to that, but I'm like, I want to I want to start like a series game that we can return to every now and then. Oh, thank god I have that looped. That would have been awkward. Imagine I didn't have my media player looped and then it just randomly started playing audio files that I had. Haha, that would be weird. Um, I'm not interested in all in Hollow Night or Silky Song. So, I probably won't stream those. That would be content. If I played a random sound on my PC is content. What? That would just be embarrassing and scary that that content dude. That's exciting. That's thrilling. I want to watch the streamer squirm and sweat. True content. What? Accidental content. Noted. noted. Yeah, I was thinking about doing a karaoke, too, because I've been in the mood to sing. I've been in the singing mood. The singing mood, but I'll have to see. I'll see play about ear. I had a kind of a busy week uh this week, so um I'll have to see. I am spending many plates. Um but yeah, I want to mention again how thankful I am for you guys. Um, I am overwhelmed, but it's all good. It's it's it's all good. It's just it's a lot, but it's good. Taking it one day at a time, she says as she laughs nervously. Nah, it's okay, though. Okay, I need to go eat. I just realized I haven't eaten anything yet. Call you crumbs. I'll call you crubs. I like crubs. What's up, my crumbs? Krubs. Grubs. Uh, reading what you guys are saying.

I'll see you guys next time. Uh, I'm going to go. Yeah. All right, Mr. Krugs, have a lovely rest of your day, your evening. Happy Monday. All right, guys. Goodbye. One. Bye. Goodbye. Coba kalian bayangkan, setiap setahun sekali, sesosok entitas kematian akan terbangun dari tidur lelapnya dan melukis angka terkutuk yang akan secara berkala menghapus populasi manusia. Semua orang yang usianya sama atau melewati angka tersebut akan musnah dari dunia, meninggalkan orang-orang tercintanya. Tahun demi tahun, angka terus menurun dan semakin banyak manusia yang menghilang. Inilah tema yang dibawakan dalam game Clair Obscur Expedition 33 garapan Sandfall Interactive, sebuah game indah, emosional, dan penuh misteri yang membawakan kisah mindblowing, sebuah mahakarya yang membuat para pemainnya, atau paling tidak saya sendiri, seolah-olah masuk ke dalam dunia lukisan sang developer dan ingin memahami setiap detail yang diberikan. Untuk itu, Hello guys kembali lagi di Channel Droomp dan selamat datang di Plot Clair Obscur Expedition 33. Sebuah pulau di tengah lautan luas bernama Lumière terpisah dari bagian dunia lainnya ketika peristiwa dahsyat yang dikenal sebagai ‘The Fracture’ terjadi 67 tahun sebelum event utama dalam game Clair Obscur, dimana bertepatan dengan terlemparnya sebagian pulau Lumière ke lautan lepas, menara batu raksasa yang disebut sebagai ‘Monolith’ muncul dari dalam permukaan air dan monster berbahaya bernama Nevron mulai menginvasi dunia. Sebagai bentuk pertahanan, para warga memutuskan untuk membangun Dome Shield di sekitar pulau Lumière agar para Nevron tidak bisa masuk. Namun pada hari yang sama, mereka menyadari keberadaan angka ‘100’ yang terpampang jelas di Monolith, angka yang dilukiskan oleh sesosok makhluk misterius bernama Paintress. Demi mencari tahu apa yang terjadi dan sekaligus berupaya menyatukan kembali Lumière dengan bagian benua lainnya, para penduduk Lumière membentuk kelompok Search and Rescue, dikenal juga sebagai kelompok Expedition Zero. Ini adalah kelompok ekspedisi pertama yang diutus untuk keluar dari pulau Lumière, namun sayang dari sekian banyaknya orang yang tergabung ke dalam kelompok Expedition Zero, hanya dua orang yang pada akhirnya kembali ke Lumière dengan selamat. Sejak itu, tidak ada seorang pun yang berani meninggalkan pulau selama 15 tahun kedepan, dimana dalam selang waktu ini, para warga Lumière menyadari bahwa angka yang terlukis di Monolith akan menghitung mundur setiap tahunnya, dan angka itu bukan sekedar angka biasa, melainkan semacam kutukan yang akan membunuh manusia dengan usia sama atau lebih tua dari angka tersebut. Orang yang musnah akan berubah menjadi kelopak mawar dan abu, meninggalkan dunia untuk selamanya tanpa alasan yang jelas. Maka dari itu, mereka menyebut peristiwa ini sebagai ‘Gommage’, artinya ‘Menghapus’ dalam bahasa Perancis, dan setiap tahunnya di hari Gommage terjadi, mereka mengadakan acara perpisahan yang akan menjadi kesempatan terakhir untuk mengucapkan selamat tinggal pada orang tercinta sebelum matahari terbenam dan Paintress melukis angka baru di Monolith. Lima belas tahun sejak peristiwa The Fracture, atau lebih tepatnya pada Tahun Monolith ke-85, dihitung mundur dari tahun Monolith ke-100 ketika menara Monolith pertama kali muncul dikurangi 15 tahun, sekelompok orang mulai memikirkan cara untuk menghentikan Gommage dengan membentuk kelompok ekspedisi baru. Orang-orang yang tergabung ke dalamnya adalah mereka yang cukup berani untuk mengambil resiko mati menjelajah ke luar pulau Lumière yang dipenuhi dengan monster Nevron, dan biasanya mereka adalah orang-orang yang waktu hidupnya sudah hampir habis alias mereka yang sudah hampir mengalami Gommage. Kelompok ekspedisi mendedikasikan waktu mereka untuk mempelajari berbagai keterampilan bertarung dan dikirim ke luar setiap tahun untuk membunuh Paintress, percaya satu-satunya cara untuk menghentikan Gommage adalah dengan menakhlukkan makhluk misterius tersebut. Namun selama bertahun-tahun lamanya, tidak ada satupun anggota ekspedisi yang kembali dengan selamat. Kenyataan ini membuat kebanyakan warga Lumière semakin takut, sehingga alih-alih memberanikan diri untuk bergabung ke dalam kelompok ekspedisi, beberapa di antara mereka mulai mempertimbangkan untuk lebih baik menghabiskan seluruh hidupnya di Lumière dengan orang terdekat sampai Gommage terjadi, atau mungkin menikmati hidup dengan melakukan hal lainnya... Sebagai akibatnya seiring berjalannya waktu, jumlah orang yang ingin bergabung ke dalam kelompok ekspedisi semakin berkurang, sedangkan di sisi lain, beberapa orang yang masih peduli dengan masa depan Lumière berusaha merekrut lebih banyak anggota. Misi ekspedisi dimulai kembali pada Tahun Monolith ke-84, dimana tidak seperti Expedition Zero, sistem penomoran untuk kelompok-kelompok ekspedisi baru ini disesuaikan dengan Tahun Monolith-nya. Mereka berangkat dengan tujuan untuk mati melawan Paintress atau paling tidak memberikan kemudahan bagi kelompok ekspedisi berikutnya. “Tomorrow Comes” atau “For Those Who Come After” adalah prinsip yang selalu mereka pegang... Beberapa kelompok ekspedisi yang memberanikan diri untuk maju demi menghentikan siklus kematian Gommage meninggalkan jurnal untuk kelompok ekspedisi berikutnya, dan ini adalah beberapa jurnal yang penting. Kelompok ekspedisi 70 cukup berjasa dalam pemasangan grapple point yang mempermudah proses penjelajahan dari satu titik ke titik lain, sedangkan kelompok ekspedisi 69 berfokus pada pemasangan pegangan tangan yang mempermudah proses pemanjatan. Sementara itu, kelompok ekspedisi yang dikenal sebagai ekspedisi legendaris karena taktiknya yang dianggap tidak lazim adalah kelompok Ekspedisi 60, dimana mereka percaya bahwa tubuh manusia adalah yang terkuat dari segalanya. Awalnya saat mereka menyampaikan hal ini, banyak orang tidak percaya dan malah mengejek, namun dengan melalui pelatihan keras tanpa henti, kelompok ekspedisi 60 pada akhirnya berhasil membuktikan perkataan tersebut. Tubuh mereka mencapai batas maksimal kemampuan manusia sampai pada titik dimana mereka dapat dengan mudah memusnahkan para Nevron. Selain itu, mereka juga jauh lebih lincah dan aerodinamis tanpa seragam berat yang membatasi kinerja otot, sehingga alih-alih menggunakan seragam ekspedisi dan senjata yang sudah didesain untuk bertahan hidup dari serangan para Nevron, kelompok ekspedisi 60 menjelajah ke luar pulau Lumière dengan tangan kosong dan tanpa seragam. Berdasarkan jurnal yang ditinggalkan, mereka berhasil membasmi para Nevron di sepanjang perjalanan dan menembus lapisan pelindung menara Monolith, lapisan yang bila disentuh sembarangan akan otomatis memicu Gommage pada orang yang menyentuhnya. Keberhasilan ini menjadikan mereka kelompok ekspedisi kedua di samping Expedition Zero yang berhasil mencapai menara batu tempat Paintress berdiam. Tapi disana mereka mendapati kenyataan yang cukup mengejutkan. Sayang sebelum sang penulis jurnal bernama William dapat memperingatkan semua orang akan kebenaran mengejutkan yang mereka temukan, waktu hidupnya sudah habis. Ia mengalami gommage ketika ia sedang berenang melintasi lautan luas dalam perjalanan kembali menuju Lumière. Satu-satunya hal yang bisa ia lakukan adalah meninggalkan jurnal, tapi jurnal ini tidak pernah sampai ke kelompok ekspedisi berikutnya. Salah satu anggota kelompok ekspedisi 59 bernama Julien bercerita tentang bagaimana salah satu rekannya, Laure, baru saja melakukan hal bodoh dengan meyakinkan yang lainnya untuk menyantap Nevron, yang dimana sebagai akibatnya, mereka yang menyantap Nevron malah jatuh sakit dan muntah-muntah. Salah satu anggota kelompok ekspedisi 54 bernama Constantine mengungkapkan kebusukan Dewan Lumière, dimana meski diasumsikan sebagian besar orang yang bergabung ke dalam ekspedisi adalah atas keinginan mereka sendiri alias sukarela, Constantine menyiratkan yang sebaliknya. Ia mengatakan bahwa jika ada orang yang menyebabkan terlalu banyak perbedaan pendapat atau mempertanyakan keputusan para dewan, maka orang itu bisa saja diikutsertakan secara paksa ke dalam ekspedisi berikutnya. Untuk itu, Constantine merasa lebih bebas berada di luar Lumière dan mengaku bahwa ia tidak berniat menghadapi Paintress, melainkan ia ingin mendirikan kota Lumière baru yang lebih baik. Kelompok Ekspedisi 44 mencoba menyamar menjadi Nevron, namun rencana mereka gagal karena Nevron dapat mengenali satu sama lain melalui chroma yang ada dalam tubuh mereka. Chroma adalah semacam energi yang berperan sebagai sumber kehidupan bagi seluruh makhluk hidup, termasuk makhluk Nevron dan manusia. Biasanya Chroma yang didapatkan dari Nevron akan digunakan sebagai mata uang. Dua anggota dari kelompok ekspedisi 40 bernama Gigi dan Edmond mengalami Gommage ketika mereka menyentuh lapisan pelindung Monolith. Nah 67 tahun setelah peristiwa The Fracture terjadi, lebih tepatnya pada Tahun Monolith ke-33, setelah total 51 kelompok ekspedisi dikirim ke luar dan tidak ada satupun dari mereka yang berhasil bertahan hidup, ini adalah saatnya bagi kelompok ekspedisi 33 untuk maju menghadapi Paintress. Kelompok Ekspedisi 33 beranggotakan total 15 orang yang kebanyakan dari mereka sudah berusia 33 tahun. Mereka hanya memiliki waktu satu tahun penuh sebelum Gommage terjadi. Tapi ada satu anggota termuda di antara mereka, yaitu seorang gadis berusia 16 tahun bernama Maelle. Tidak seperti kebanyakan orang yang menunggu hingga waktu hidup mereka sudah hampir habis sebelum bergabung ke dalam ekspedisi, Maelle memandang ekspedisi sebagai kesempatannya untuk menjelajahi dunia luar. Dan ini bukan tanpa alasan, melainkan ada kaitannya dengan masa lalu Maelle. Kedua orang tua Maelle mengalami Gommage saat putri mereka masih menginjak usia 3 tahun, menjadikan Maelle sebagai salah satu dari banyaknya anak yatim piatu di Lumière. Setelah bertahun-tahun hidup berpindah-pindah dari satu keluarga asuh ke keluarga lain, dimana hal ini bisa terjadi karena ia dianggap sebagai anak aneh yang suka berbicara sendiri dan kerap mengalami mimpi buruk, belum lagi sulit diatur karena sering melarikan diri dari rumah, Maelle akhirnya dirawat oleh seorang pria bernama Gustave dan saudarinya, Emma. Mereka berdua merawat Maelle dengan sepenuh hati sampai-sampai di mata Maelle, Gustave sudah seperti kakak dan sekaligus ayahnya sendiri. Tapi tetap saja, karena kepribadiannya yang unik, ia sulit mendapatkan teman di Lumière dan hanya bisa bekerja sebagai penjaga gudang. Maka dari itulah, setelah mengetahui bahwa Gustave tergabung ke dalam ekspedisi 33, ia memutuskan untuk ikut. Gustave, di sisi lain, adalah seorang insinyur yang sangat dihormati di Lumière karena telah mengabdikan sebagian besar hidupnya untuk perbaikan kota. Salah satu kontribusinya adalah Projek Aquafarm 3 yang ia kerjakan bersama temannya, Sciel, dan pacanya, Sophie, dimana melalui projek itu, mereka berhasil mengamankan pasokan makanan untuk banyak orang. Selain itu, ia juga membantu memperkuat Shield Dome yang menjadi lapisan pelindung kota Lumière. Atas kecerdasannya ini, beberapa anak memutuskan untuk mengikuti jejaknya dan menjadi muridnya. Gustave hanya bisa berharap mereka akan menjadi penerusnya suatu hari nanti setelah ia tiada. Tapi meski Gustave menjalin hubungan yang sangat baik dengan Sophie, hubungan itu menjadi renggang akibat perbedaan pendapat tentang apakah sebaiknya mereka memiliki anak atau tidak di dunia yang penuh ketidakpastian ini. Pada akhirnya mereka memutuskan untuk berpisah, dan meski keduanya masih berteman, selama 4 tahun lamanya, Gustave dan Sophie tidak pernah lagi berbicara satu sama lain. Nah game Clair Obscur Expedition 33 dimulai 4 tahun setelah Gustave dan Sophie mengakhiri hubungan mereka, atau lebih tepatnya di hari terakhir Tahun Monolith ke 34 ketika orang-orang berusia 34 tahun akan mengalami Gommage, Sophie adalah salah satunya. Dengan perasaan hati kacau balau, Gustave yang berusia satu tahun lebih muda dari Sophie, yakni 33 tahun, seperti biasa menghabiskan waktu di sebuah balkon melempar batu ke arah Monolith yang menunjukkan angka 34. Diletakkan di dekatnya adalah setangkai bunga mawar yang ia persiapkan untuk Sophie, dan Maelle yang menyadari hal ini mengusul agar Gustave segera memberikannya sebelum Sophie mengalami Gommage. Disini Maelle juga sempat berbicara tentang tangan kiri Gustave yang sudah digantikan dengan tangan prostetik. Tidak ada kejelasan mengenai apa yang terjadi, selain bahwa Gustave kehilangan tangan kirinya pada satu titik dan ia meminta para muridnya untuk membuatkan tangan prostetik yang dilengkapi dengan aliran listrik sebagai pengganti, memungkinkannya untuk mengisi daya listrik dan menggunakannya dalam pertarungan. Dengan membawa setangkai bunga mawar, Gustave memberanikan diri untuk menemui Sophie yang baru saja mengucapkan selamat tinggal pada kedua temannya. Bunga yang dikalungkan di leher Sophie merupakan semacam hadiah terakhir dari orang-orang terdekatnya sebagai bentuk perpisahan, yang dimana hal ini sudah menjadi tradisi dalam acara perpisahan sebelum Gommage terjadi. Gustave menambahkan setangkai bunga mawar dan keduanya menyampaikan perasaan rindu satu sama lain, sebelum kemudian mereka sepakat bahwa mereka memang tidak bisa menyatukan 2 pikiran yang berbeda. Sementara Sophie ingin mereka menghabiskan waktu di Lumière, Gustave bersikeras ingin melakukan ekspedisi demi menghadapi Paintress yang dipercaya telah merenggut masa depan manusia selama bertahun-tahun. Sophie tidak pernah menyalahkan Gustave atas itu, mengklaim Gustave adalah orang paling keras kepala yang pernah ia kenali. Ia lalu meminta Gustave menemaninya ke area pelabuhan, tempat semua orang berkumpul untuk menghadiri acara perpisahan. Setibanya disana, mereka dihampiri oleh beberapa murid Gustave yang membawakan seragam ekspedisi miliknya, mengklaim mereka disuruh oleh Sophie. Ini adalah hal terakhir yang bisa dilakukan Sophie, dan karena ia ingin melihat Gustave mengenakan seragam tersebut, ia pun memakaikannya... Keduanya bergandengan tangan dan menunggu di pelabuhan hingga matahari terbenam, dimana pada saat itulah Paintress terbangun dari tidur lelapnya, menghapus angka 34, dan melukis angka 33, seketika memulai peristiwa Gommage... Gustave sangat terpukul dengan kematian Sophie, namun di saat yang bersamaan, momen perpisahan ini menjadi api membara yang mendorongnya untuk menghancurkan Paintress. Setelah dihibur oleh kedua rekan seperjuangannya, ia menerima buku jurnal dari salah satu muridnya bernama Alexandre yang memintanya untuk menuliskan setiap detail perjalanannya di luar, yakin ekspedisi 33 akan berhasil menghancurkan Paintress. Gustave berjanji asal mereka menjaga Lumière selama ia pergi. Menemui Maelle yang sedang menyendiri di ujung dermaga, Gustave mengingatkannya kembali akan keputusannya dalam bergabung ke dalam kelompok ekspedisi 33. Tapi tampaknya keputusan Maelle sudah bulat, meski ia masih memiliki 9 tahun masa hidup, ia merasa lebih baik ia keluar dari pada harus menjalani hidup selama 9 tahun di Lumière. Di tengah perbincangan ini, Emma, saudari Gustave yang merupakan konselor utama kota Lumière datang untuk menyampaikan pidato sebelum keberangkatan kelompok ekspedisi 33. Emma sebenarnya tidak setuju dengan keputusan Gustave untuk bergabung ke dalam ekspedisi 33, terutama karena ia percaya Gustave bisa berkontribusi lebih banyak dalam perkembangan kota Lumière, tapi di sisi lain, ia juga memahami bahwa ekspedisi adalah satu-satunya harapan bagi mereka untuk menghentikan Gommage. Bagaimanapun juga, Emma pada akhirnya tidak memiliki pilihan lain selain membiarkan Gustave pergi dan memintanya untuk menjaga Maelle baik-baik. Di hadapan seluruh anggota kelompok ekspedisi 33, Emma menyampaikan pidato berisi ungkapan terima kasih atas dedikasi mereka dalam memperjuangkan masa depan Lumière. Ia mengingatkan bahwa ketika mereka menghadapi Paintress, seluruh warga Lumière ada di sisi mereka... Saat matahari terbit di hari esok, kelompok ekspedisi 33 memulai ekpedisi mereka... Setibanya di pesisir pantai gelap, seluruh anggota ekspedisi 33 langsung dibuat terkejut ketika mereka dihampiri oleh seorang pria misterius yang berjalan menembus kabut tebal sambil membawa sebuah tongkat di tangan kanannya... Mereka tidak percaya dengan apa yang mereka lihat, seorang pria berwajah keriput dan berambut putih yang mungkin umurnya sudah mencapai 50 tahun ke atas, tapi pria itu masih hidup dan tidak mengalami Gommage. Alan selaku pemimpin ekspedisi 33 yang menyadari potensi ancaman meminta para anggotanya untuk bersiap. Namun saat ia menanyakan alasan si pria misterius tidak terkena Gommage... Ledakan beruntun seketika memecah keheningan, dan Gustave yang terkena imbas dari sebuah ledakan hanya bisa menyaksikan bagaimana rekannya mati satu persatu, paling tidak sebelum ia disadarkan oleh Lucien yang memintanya untuk berlindung di balik bongkahan batu. Sadar mereka tidak mungkin mampu menghadapi sang pria misterius, Tristan mengusul agar mereka berkumpul di titik yang telah ditentukan, yaitu di Indigo Tree. Namun sebelum bisa menjalankan rencana itu, sejumlah monster mengerikan bernama Noir menghabisi sebagian besar anggota ekspedisi 33 dan menghantam Gustave... Gustave mendapatkan kembali kesadarannya di dekat air terjun Spring Meadows dan bergegas pergi menuju Indigo Tree dengan harapan dapat bertemu kembali dengan anggota ekspedisi 33 yang selamat. Namun setelah sempat menghadapi Nevron, ia mendapati banyak sekali mayat anggota ekspedisi pendahulu yang berserakan di sepanjang jalan, dan ia seketika kehilangan harapan ketika menemukan sebagian besar anggota ekspedisi 33 telah mati setelah disergap oleh sang pria misterius di pesisir pantai. Gustave terduduk pasrah di dekat tumpukan mayat para rekannya dan menyadari keberadaan beberapa di antara mereka yang semalam masih bersenang-senang di acara perpisahan. Putus asa, ia mengeluarkan sebuah pistol dan hendak mengakhiri semuanya... Beruntung Lune menghentikan upaya Gustave. Lune adalah salah satu anggota ekspedisi 33 yang lahir dari peneliti terkemuka, dan karena itu, ia memiliki rasa haus yang besar akan pengetahuan dan kini hanya memiliki satu tujuan, yaitu untuk mengungkap misteri Paintress. Lune dapat memahami keputusasaan Gustave, namun ia mengingatkannya dengan prinsip lain yang mereka pegang, “ketika yang lainnya gugur, mereka harus tetap maju.”. Situasi kemudian memaksa Gustave untuk bangkit berdiri ketika sesosok Nevron datang menghampiri mereka, memaksa keduanya untuk bekerjasama sebelum melanjutkan perjalanan menuju Indigo Tree, dimana di tengah perjalanan, mereka sempat bertemu dengan monster Nevron berwarna putih yang tidak bersifat agresif dan bahkan bisa berkomunikasi, disebut White Nevron. Gustave juga menyadari bahwa manusia yang terbunuh oleh Nevron tidak menghilang seperti efek Gommage, dan Lune hanya bisa menyimpulkan bahwa kemungkinan Nevron menyerang dengan cara merusak chroma yang ada dalam tubuh manusia, membuat manusia yang mati terjebak di dalam tubuh mereka untuk selamanya. Melanjutkan perjalanan, Gustave dan Lune tidak sengaja menyaksikan kematian salah satu rekan mereka bernama Leo di tangan Nevron Eveque, dan saat keduanya hendak melarikan diri karena melihat ukuran Eveque yang begitu besar, jalan kembali tertutup oleh tanaman merambat, tidak memberikan mereka pilihan lain selain menghadapinya. Gustave cukup bangga dengan kemampuan bertarungnya, dan bersama Lune, ia mencapai indigo Tree yang seharusnya menjadi titik kumpul bagi seluruh anggota ekspedisi 33, tapi disana, bukannya menemukan sesama rekan seperjuangan, mereka malah menemukan pesan yang ditinggalkan oleh seseorang di pohon, berbunyi, “Aku membawa Maelle ke Weird Corals. Pergi ke utara dan cari pintu di dalam gubuk.” Pesan tersebut seketika menimbulkan perbedaaan pendapat, dimana sementara Lune berpikir ini adalah jebakan karena isi pesan tidak terlihat seperti pesan yang akan ditulis oleh anggota ekspedisi, Gustave yang sudah terlanjur gelisah tidak mengerti nasib Maelle, menganggapnya sebagai sebuah petunjuk, mengklaim siapapun yang meninggalkan pesan mengenali Maelle dan mereka harus segera mencarinya. Lune mengingatkan protokol yang harus mereka taati, yakni jika ada anggota ekspedisi yang terpisah, mereka harus menunggu di titik kumpul selama 3 hari. Jika memang benar pesan di pohon ditulis oleh anggota ekspedisi, seharusnya mereka menunggu disini, bukannya pergi ke tempat lain dan meninggalkan pesan. Gustave, di sisi lain, menyampaikan asumsinya tentang bagaimana mungkin saja ada suatu ancaman yang memaksa mereka untuk melarikan diri, menekankan bahwa protokol tidak mencakup setiap kemungkinan yang bisa berubah kapan saja di lapangan. Sadar mereka tidak memiliki banyak waktu, Gustave mengatakan bahwa apapun yang terjadi, ia akan pergi mencari Maelle dan kemudian mengingatkan Lune dengan protokol yang berbunyi, “Jangan pernah bergerak sendiri”, memaksa Lune untuk memilih protokol mana yang ingin ia langgar. Lune terpaksa mengikuti Gustave. Mereka menyempatkan diri untuk beristirahat sejenak dan berbicara tentang peristiwa mematikan di pesisir pantai yang membunuh sebagian besar anggota ekspedisi 33. Lune menyalahkan dirinya karena dialah yang mengusul pada Alan untuk mendarat disana, namun satu hal yang mengganggu pikirannya hingga saat ini adalah keberadaan sang pria misterius yang rasanya sangat tidak masuk akal. Bagaimana bisa ia selamat dari Gommage? Gustave tidak memiliki jawaban untuk itu, namun satu hal yang ia ketahui adalah bahwa ia harus segera menyelamatkan Maelle dan membawanya pulang ke Lumière. Perkataan ini seketika membuat Lune terkejut, dan meski Lune telah mengingatkan Gustave pada tujuan utama mereka melakukan ekspedisi, yaitu untuk menakhlukkan Paintress, Gustave mengaku tidak peduli lagi dengan misi mereka karena ia yakin mereka tidak akan berhasil menakhlukkan Paintress bila hanya beranggotakan 3 orang. Atas ini, Lune menyebut Gustave sebagai seorang pengecut dan mengingatkannya pada sumpah yang mereka semua, termasuk Maelle, katakan sebelum bergabung ke dalam ekspedisi, sumpah untuk tetap melanjutkan misi meski yang lainnya telah gugur dan bahwa masa depan Lumière lebih penting dari pada nyawa seseorang. Gustave terdiam untuk beberapa saat sebelum mengatakan bahwa ia harap ia masih bisa mempertahankan sumpahnya itu, seketika mencairkan ketegangan di antara mereka berdua... Setelah menulis jurnal di buku harian pemberian muridnya, Gustave melanjutkan perjalanan bersama Lune ke utara menuju Weird Corals, tempat mereka menemukan gubuk yang dimaksud dan membuka pintu di dalamnya. Tanpa sepengetahuan mereka, seseorang mengawasi dari kejauhan... Pintu dalam gubuk mengarahkan Gustave dan Lune ke sebuah manor megah tak berpenghuni, namun memasuki satu-satunya ruangan yang terbuka, bertemulah mereka dengan Maelle yang sedang sibuk mendengarkan jurnal peninggalan ekspedisi pendahulu. Tanpa pikir panjang, Gustave segera melepas rindu pada Maelle, ia menjadi sangat lega melihat melihat Maelle dalam kondisi baik-baik saja, begitu pula dengan Lune yang hanya bisa terdiam menyadari bahwa pesan yang mereka temukan di Indigo Tree mengatakan kebenaran. Lune bertanya bagaimana Maelle bisa sampai disini, dan saat Maelle memberitahu bahwa ia tidak ingat jelas apa yang terjadi setelah kejadian di pesisir pantai, sesosok makhluk misterius bernama The Curator menampakkan diri, membuat Gustave dan Lune waspada. Sebelum terjadi kesalahpahaman, Maelle lanjut bercerita, mengatakan ia tiba-tiba saja terbangun di Manor bersama The Curator yang banyak membantu dengan memperkuat pictos miliknya. Pictos adalah perlengkapan yang dibawa oleh setiap anggota ekspedisi dan berfungsi untuk membantu mereka menghadapi Nevron, dimana setiap pictos memiliki fungsi khusus yang berbeda-beda. Lune merasakan adanya perbedaan Chroma dalam tubuh the Curator... Sementara itu, saat ditanyakan tentang pesan yang ditinggalkan di Indigo Tree, Maelle mengaku tidak tahu apa-apa. Pintu keluar manor dihadang oleh The Curator yang hanya mengeluarkan suara gerangan saat dihampiri, namun meski begitu, Maelle dapat memahami apa yang dikatakan olehnya, The Curator tidak akan membiarkan mereka keluar sebelum menjalani pelatihan. Berhasil membuktikan kelayakan mereka, Maelle mengajak The Curator ikut dalam ekspedisi ini. Gustave, Lune, dan Maelle beranjak keluar dari manor, ketika makhluk dengan rambut menyerupai kuas lukis tiba-tiba melompat ke arah mereka, seketika membuat Lune terkejut tidak main menyadari bahwa makhluk Gestral benar-benar ada. Gestral adalah makhluk yang sudah ada jauh sebelum peristiwa the Fracture terjadi, namun para warga Lumière hanya mengenal mereka dari Expedition Zero dan menganggap mereka sebagai makhluk legendaris yang lucu dan suka bermain. Beberapa orang bahkan tidak percaya akan keberadaan Gestral. Nah Gestral kecil yang muncul di hadapan Gustave, Lune, dan Maelle adalah Noco, dan dengan konyolnya ia menuduh Lune dan Gustave sebagai penyusup, mengklaim seseorang bernama Verso tidak akan senang melihat ini, paling tidak sebelum Maelle memberitahu bahwa Lune dan Gustave adalah temannya. Lune adalah orang yang paling bersemangat saat bertemu dengan Noco, selama ini ia pikir Gestral hanyalah cerita legenda, dan sekarang setelah bertemu dengannya secara langsung, ia mulai berpikir bahwa mungkin Grandis dan Esquie yang juga adalah cerita legenda di Lumière benar-benar ada. Saat mendengar tentang bagaimana kelompok ekspedisi 33 sedang berupaya mencapai kediaman Paintress, Noco memberitahu bahwa ada lautan luas yang memisahkan pulau tempat mereka berada saat ini dengan Monolith tempat Paintress berdiam, sehingga tentu mereka memerlukan sesuatu untuk berenang melintasi lautan. Untuk itu, ia menyarankan mereka pergi mencari bantuan pada kepala desa Gestral bernama Golgra. Kabar ini membuat Lune kegirangan, karena dengan begitu, ia akan bertemu lebih banyak Gestral. Di tengah upaya mencari jalan keluar dari Weird Corals, Gustave sempat terdistraksi dengan setangkai bunga mawar indah yang mengingatkannya kembali pada Sophie. Namun tanpa sadar, dengan mencabut bunga itu, mereka membuat marah sesosok nevron bernama Goblu yang langsung menyerang, memaksa mereka bertiga untuk menghadapinya meski Lune tahu bahwa alasan di balik kemarahan Goblu adalah karena Gustave mencabut bunga mawar tersebut. Untuk itu sebelum Gustave melakukan serangan terakhir, Lune menghentikannya dan mengatakan bahwa nevron yang satu ini tidak akan menyerang selama mereka tidak menyentuh bunga di area itu. Maelle yang merasa familiar dengan Goblu berjalan mendekat dan berusaha berkomunikasi dengannya, namun sang nevron pergi begitu saja... Mereka bertiga kemudian mengikuti arahan Noco dengan berjalan menuju pepohonan berwarna merah yang menjadi tanda bahwa desa Gestral sudah dekat. Saat mereka sedang beristirahat, Gustave menemani Maelle yang sedang kesulitan menerima kematian atas rekan seperjuangannya dan mengaku sering mengalami mimpi buruk belakangan ini, mimpi tentang suatu peristiwa kelam yang tidak ia ketahui. Gustave menghibur dan membuatnya berjanji untuk melarikan diri bila mereka bertemu dengan sang pria misterius sekali lagi. Ia juga berjanji akan melakukan hal yang sama. Di sisi lain, The Curator menerima ajakan Maelle untuk ikut dalam ekspedisi dan bersedia membantu memperkuat mereka. Setelah Gustave sedikit berbincang santai dengan Lune, yang dimana disini Gustave sudah mendapatkan kembali harapannya untuk berjuang menghadapi Paintress bersama-sama, Gustave menulis jurmal di buku harian dan ketiganya melanjutkan perjalanan menuju desa Gestral. Mereka harus terlebih dahulu melalui Ancient Sanctuary, tempat mereka bertemu dengan bayang-bayang anak kecil, kita sebut Young Boy, yang kata-katanya terdengar sangat acak, berbicara tentang bagaimana ia adalah bagian dari sebuah mimpi atau ilusi dan bagaimana ia sudah rindu tertawa dengan yang lainnya. Bagaimanapun juga, Young Boy terdiam dan menolak berbicara lebih lanjut setelah menyampaikan semua itu. Young Boy akan beberapa kali muncul di sepanjang perjalanan ekspedisi 33. Setibanya di desa Gestral tempat berbagai makhluk Gestral berdiam, mereka segera menemui Golgra yang memberitahu bahwa satu-satunya cara untuk melintasi lautan menuju kediaman Paintress adalah dengan meminta bantuan Esquie, sekali lagi membuat Lune bersemangat mengetahui bahwa Esquie benar-benar ada. Esquie tinggal tidak jauh dari sini, tapi hanya prajurit terhebat yang diperbolehkan untuk memasuki kediamannya dan itu pun mereka perlu mengucapkan kata sandi. Untuk mendapatkan kata sandi yang diperlukan, Golgra meminta mereka berpartisipasi dalam Turnamen Legendaris yang diadakan oleh para Gestral. Tidak memiliki pilihan lain, Gustave, Maelle, dan Lune terpaksa ikut berpartisipasi dalam turnamen dan berhasil menumbangkan ketiga pejuang Gestral. Namun saat memulai turnamen keempat, mereka dibuat terkejut ketika menyadari bahwa musuh mereka adalah Sciel, salah satu anggota ekspedisi 33 yang sudah dikenal sebagai juara beruntun di turnamen itu. Sciel juga sama terkejutnya mendapati rekan seperjuangannya masih hidup, tapi mereka tidak bisa berlama-lama melepas rindu karena seluruh Gestral mendesak mereka untuk bertarung. Seusai turnamen berakhir, keempatnya berkumpul dan Sciel memberitahu bahwa setelah seluruh anggota eksepdisi 33 terpisah di pesisir pantai, ia terdampar di sebuah hutan dan harus bertahan hidup menghadapi para Nevron. Beruntung ia bertemu dengan makhluk Gestral yang membimbingnya ke desa ini. Sciel lalu balik bertanya, bagaimana mereka bisa sampai disini, namun saat Gustave hendak bercerita, Lune yang menyadari ekspresi sedih dalam diri Gustave, mengingat Gustave sangat terpukul atas kematian rekan seperjuangannya dan bahkan sempat berusaha mengakhiri hidup, langsung menyela dan mengusul agar mereka segera menemui Golgra. Sesuai janji, Golgra memberitahu kata sandi untuk memasuki sarang kediaman Esquie... Mereka harus meneriakkan ‘Get outta my way’ atau ‘Menyingkirlah dari jalanku’ ke Sunniso yang berperan sebagai penjaga kediaman Esquie. Ekspedisi 33 berterima kasih atas bantuan Golgra dan menantang Golgra dalam sebuah duel... Ok lupakan. Di tengah peristirahatan mereka ketika Sciel dan Lune sedang bersemengat mengetahui bahwa sebentar lagi mereka akan bertemu dengan Esquie, makhluk yang selama ini mereka kira hanya merupakan bagian dalam cerita legenda, Maelle terdiam dan merasakan sesuatu, sebelum kemudian ia tiba-tiba seolah ditarik ke dunia monokrom tempat ia berhadapan dengan gadis berambut putih yang menutupi wajahnya dengan topeng retak. Sang gadis menatap ke arah Maelle, berjalan mendekat, dan hendak menyentuh wajahnya, namun pria misterius sama yang sempat muncul di pesisir pantai kembali menampakkan diri dan meminta sang gadis yang ia panggil sebagai Alicia untuk pulang. Alicia menunjuk-nunjuk Maelle dan sang pria misterius mengartikan gesturnya sebagai bentuk kekesalan Alicia terhadap Maelle yang ia salahkan atas semua ini. Maelle, di sisi lain, tidak mengerti apa yang terjadi, namun bukannya memberi kejelasan, sang pria misterius malah memperingatkan bahwa kehadiran Maelle disini hanya akan memperburuk situasi dan menyarankannya untuk membawa pulang seluruh temannya. Pengelihatan berakhir ketika Maelle menebaskan pedangnya, seketika mengembalikan keadaan menjadi normal dengan Gustsave, Sciel, dan Lune menyadari bahwa ada sesuatu yang tidak beres. Maelle, dengan napas yang tersengal-sengal, mengatakan bahwa ia baru saja bertemu dengan sang pria misterius yang kali ini ditemani oleh seorang gadis bertopeng. Lune berusaha menenangkan Maelle dan memintanya untuk membeberkan setiap detail atas pengelihatan yang didapatkannya itu, namun saat mendengar perkataan Maelle tentang bagaimana sang pria misterius menyarankan mereka untuk pulang karena kalau tidak, Maelle hanya akan memperburuk situasi, dan belum lagi, selama mendapatkan pengelihatan itu, Gustave, Lune, dan Sciel membeku, semuanya menjadi sangat khawatir. Gustave meminta Maelle untuk fokus beristirahat, mengklaim mereka bisa menanyakan detailnya di hari esok. Di hari berikutnya, mereka berempat mencapai sarang kediaman Esquie, dimana sesuai dengan perkataan Golgra si kepala desa Gestral, kediamannya dijaga oleh makhluk Gestral bernama Sunniso, mengharuskan mereka untuk mengucapkan kata sandi ‘Get Outta My Way’ sekeras mungkin. Keempatnya sepakat Gustave memiliki suara yang paling nyaring, sehingga dengan berat hati, ia pun melakukannya... Setelah melalui pertemua n yang sangat canggung dengan Sunniso, mereka berempat akhirnya bertemu dengan Esquie, makhluk berbadan besar yang sama seperti Gestral, sudah ada sebelum peristiwa The Fracture terjadi. Meskipun sifatnya sangat konyol, Esquie dulu dikenal sebagai makhluk paling kuat di dunia. Namun dalam pertemuan ini, perhatian Esquie hanya tertuju pada Sciel seorang. Ia berbicara seolah mereka dulu sudah pernah bertemu dan menyebut Sciel sebagai seorang perenang yang buruk. Apa yang dimaksud oleh Esquie? Untuk mengetahui hal ini, kita harus mempelajari latar belakang Sciel terlebih dahulu. Pada satu titik, Sciel menjalin hubungan dengan seorang pria bernama Pierre dan keduanya memutuskan untuk menikah. Pierre mengajukan diri menjadi sukarelawan di sebuah sekolah di Lumière, mengajari anak-anak cara berlayar dan bertahan hidup di alam liar. Namun pada sekitar Tahun Monolith ke-39, 6 tahun yang lalu, ia meninggal setelah mengalami kecelakaan di sebuah pulau yang terletak di dekat Lumière dan tubuhnya hanyut di lautan. Saat mendengar kabar tentang kematian suaminya, Sciel jatuh ke dalam lubang keputusasaan yang teramat dalam dan memutuskan untuk mengakhiri seluruh penderitaannya dengan menenggelamkan diri, namun tanpa sepengetahuannya, saat kehilangan kesadaran, ia diselamatkan oleh Esquie yang membawanya kembali ke dermaga di tepi pulau Lumière. Beberapa waktu kemudian, Sciel terkejut ketika mendapati bahwa ia sedang hamil dan mengalami keguguran, membuatnya merasa bersalah. Sejak itu, ia tidak pernah lagi menyentuh lautan. Ia mengisi kehidupannya dengan mengajar di sekolah sama tempat Pierre dulu mengajar, dimana terkadang ia diingatkan kembali dengan rasa sakit yang ia alami di masa lalu ketika mendengar cerita dari murid-muridnya. Di hari perpisahan ketika ia berangkat bersama anggota ekspedisi 33, para muridnya membuatkan gelang perpisahan. Itulah ceritanya kenapa Esquie mengenali Sciel sebagai perenang yang buruk, namun Sciel sendiri tidak pernah tahu apa maksudnya. Anggota ekspedisi 33 menyampaikan maksud kedatangan mereka kesini, yaitu untuk meminta bantuan pada Esquie dalam menyeberangi lautan menuju kediaman Paintress. Namun Esquie menolak membantu sebelum mereka merebut kembali batu kesayangannya bernama Florrie yang dicuri oleh musuh bebuyutannya, Francois. Mereka tidak perlu pergi ke tempat jauh yang dipenuhi Nevron untuk menemukan keberadaan Francois, melainkan hanya perlu pergi ke goa sebelah. Setibanya di goa tempat Francois berdiam, mereka mendapatkan sambutan yang sangat buruk karena salah dikira ingin mencuri sesuatu darinya, tidak memberikan mereka pilihan lain selain menghadapi si makhluk kura-kura. Namun setelah menakhlukkan Francois, merebut kembali batu yang dimaksud, dan mengembalikannya pada Esquie, Esquie menyadari bahwa batu yang mereka bawakan bukan batu kesayangannya, Florrie. Di tengah kebingungan ini, Francois berteriak bangga, mengatakan ia tidak pernah mencuri batu kesayangan Esquie dan memberitahu bahwa Florrie ada di Stone Wave Cliffs. Esquie sedikit kecewa mendengar ini tapi berjanji akan membantu ekspedisi 33 jika mereka membantunya mencari Florrie di Stone Wave Cliffs. Nah Esquie sebenarnya memiliki banyak kemampuan seperti berenang, terbang, dan menyelam, tapi setiap kali seseorang menyinggung tentang itu, ia selalu beralasan memerlukan lebih banyak batu untuk mengaktifkan potensi penuhnya, secara tidak langsung menolak permintaan bantuan ekspedisi 33 yang merasa akan lebih mudah bila mereka memanfaatkan kemampuan tersebut. Sama seperti Noco, disini Esquie juga menyebut nama Verso, mengklaim Verso adalah sahabatnya. Tidak memiliki pilihan lain, ekspedisi 33 terpaksa menerima kesepakatan Esquie, dan untungnya Stone Wave Cliffs terletak satu jalur dengan Monolith, membawa mereka selangkah lebih dekat menuju kediaman Paintress. Saat mereka beristirahat, Maelle akhirnya memutuskan untuk bersuara tentang pengelihatannya semalam. Entah kenapa, menurutnya sang pria misterius dan Alicia sangat mengenali dirinya, seolah mereka memiliki hubungan khusus. Dan seperti biasa setiap kali Maelle mencurahkan seluruh isi hatinya, Gustave selalu hadir untuk mendengarkan dan bahkan membuatnya tertawa kembali. Keduanya menghabiskan waktu bersama untuk bermain lempar batu... Malam itu tanpa sepengetahuan Maelle yang sedang tertidur, ia lagi-lagi dihampiri oleh Alicia dan sang pria misterius. Kali ini Alicia mengungkapkan perasaan irinya pada Maelle... pada Mael Ekspedisi 33 mencapai Stone Wave Cliffs di hari berikutnya, dimana disana mereka menyaksikan bagaimana Esquie beterbangan di udara dan dapat dengan mudah menakhlukkan nevron raksasa hanya dengan sekali hantaman. Tapi seperti biasa, Equie menolak membawa ekspedisi 33 bersamanya hanya karena ia malas, sehingga Gustave, Lune, Maelle, dan Sciel harus menempuh perjalanan panjang penuh rintangan hingga akhirnya tiba di jalan masuk sebuah goa, tempat Esquie mengaku merasakan sesuatu yang mengerikan. Benar saja di dalam goa, mereka segera disambut oleh Nevron bernama Lampmaster yang di luar dugaan mudah untuk ditakhlukkan, namun tepat di saat Maelle baru saja meremehkannya, goa tiba-tiba saja terguncang dan Lampmaster kembali menampakkan diri, kali ini dengan kekuatan yang tidak bisa dipandang sebelah mata. Ekspedisi 33 harus mengerahkan seluruh kekuatannya untuk menakhlukkan Lampmaster sekali lagi, dan saat mereka berhasil menumbangkannya, Sciel menemukan batu kesayangan Esquie, Florrie. Esquie menjadi sangat kegirangan, dan sesuai janji, ia bersedia membantu ekspedisi 33 menyeberangi lautan luas menuju kediaman Paintress. Meski Sciel memiliki ketakutan terhadap laut, ia tidak memiliki pilihan lain selain memberanikan diri untuk melompat ke atas tubuh Esquie yang mengambang di atas lautan mengikuti aba-aba Lune. Sementara itu, Maelle dan Gustave yang masih berada di goa mengambil waktu sejenak untuk menatap ke arah Monolith yang kini jaraknya sudah jauh lebih dekat dari sebelumnya. Maelle mengusul agar Gustave mencoba melempar satu batu, siapa tahu kali ini batu itu bisa mengenai Monolith. Dan Gustave memutuskan untuk mencobanya. Tanpa sepengetahuan mereka berdua, sang pria misterius lagi-lagi menampakkan diri dan secara perlahan berjalan mendekat. Gustave mencari-cari batu yang layak untuk dilempar, namun sebelum ia bisa menyelesaikan gurauannya pada Maelle... Sekali saja terkena serangan sang pria misterius, Gustave langsung sekarat, dan dalam keadaan terengah-engah, ia menyuruh Maelle untuk melarikan diri. Lebih sialnya lagi, Maelle tidak bisa membantu karena sang pria misterius mengurungnya di semacam lapisan energi... Menggunakan sisa tenaganya, Gustave menantang sang pria misterius dalam duel, namun sekuat apapun ia menyerang, sang pria misterius tidak terluka sama sekali dan hanya berdiri diam tanpa melawan balik. Di sisi lain, melihat Gustave dan Maelle masih belum juga turun, Sciel sadar ada sesuatu yang tidak beres, sehingga Lune meminta Esquie untuk mempertemukan mereka kembali pada teman-temannya. Esquie mengaku tidak bisa bergerak, dan menjadi jelas kenapa hal itu bisa terjadi ketika Lampmaster yang terungkap masih hidup kembali menampakkan diri, memaksa Sciel dan Lune untuk menghadapinya. Maelle hanya bisa melihat Gustave berupaya sekuat tenaga menghadapi sang pria misterius yang sama sekali tidak berkutik, sehingga dalam upaya terakhir, Gustave mengeluarkan teknik pamungkasnya... Teknik itu berhasil menghempas sang pria misterius cukup jauh hingga menabrak dinding goa, namun sebagai akibat dari pengisian daya secara berlebihan, tangan kiri Gustave mengalami kerusakan... Sadar sang pria misterius masih hidup, Gustave mengeluarkan senjatanya dan menyerang, hanya untuk berakhir terbunuh tepat di hadapan Maelle... Jeritan Maelle berhasil menghancurkan lapisan energi yang mengurungnya, sedikit mengejutkan sang pria misterius yang kemudian membiarkannya menangisi jasad Gustave. Sang pria misterius berjalan menghampiri Maelle dan mengatakan bahwa Maelle masih belum mengerti apa yang sebenarnya terjadi, tapi ia berusaha meyakinkannya bahwa apa yang ia lakukan adalah demi kebaikan masa depan. Setelah menyampaikan semua itu, ia menghentak tubuh Maelle, memindahkan jiwanya ke alam lain dan membiarkannya mendengarkan perdebatan 2 orang yang sama sekali tidak dikenali... Setelah diperdengarkan pada perdebatan itu, jiwa Maelle menyatu kembali dengan tubuhnya dan sang pria misterius memberitahu bahwa mereka berdua hanya ingin yang terbaik untuk keluarga. Ia meminta maaf karena telah melibatkan Maelle, tapi ia sudah berusaha memperingatkan sebelumnya. Tepat di saat sang pria misterius hendak membunuh Maelle, seorang pria asing bernama Verso datang menyelamatkannya. Verso tampaknya paham betul apa yang sebenarnya terjadi dan meminta sang pria misterius untuk merelakan kematian seseorang, mengklaim keluarga yang didambakan oleh sang pria misterius bukanlah keluarga aslinya. Keluarga aslinya adalah Alicia, gadis bertopeng retak yang dibawa Verso kesini. Verso kemudian membantu Maelle bangkit berdiri dan membiarkannya pergi bersama Lune dan Sciel, sedangkan ia sendiri berjanji akan mengurusi masalah ini. Sang pria misterius memperingatkan Verso akan konsekuensi fatal yang bisa terjadi bila Verso menempuh jalur yang berseberangan dengannya. Dan dengan kesadaran penuh, Verso bertekad untuk menghentikan Paintress... Bagi kalian yang merasa semakin bingung dengan arah cerita game Clair Obscur, terutama tentang apa yang dikatakan oleh sang pria misterius, ikuti saja, nanti akan ada penjelasan tentang apa yang sebenarnya terjadi. Maelle tak kuasa menahan tangis atas kematian Gustave yang sudah ia anggap sebagai sosok ayah dan kakaknya, membuat Esquie yang ikut sedih menawarkan pelukan hangat... Malam itu ketika semuanya sudah tertidur, Verso datang untuk mengembalikan tangan kiri Gustave yang tertinggal di goa dan memberitahu bahwa cara termudah untuk mencapai Monolith adalah dengan melalui area pertambangan di sebelah utara. Lune dan Sciel tentu menyambut kehadiran Verso dengan penuh kecurigaan, terutama karena Verso terlihat jauh lebih tua dari mereka dan mengenakan seragam ekspedisi. Verso menyesal ia tidak bisa menyelamatkan Gustave, namun ia kemudian memberitahu bahwa alasan ia mengenakan seragam ekspedisi adalah karena ia juga adalah anggota ekspedisi, lebih tepatnya anggota Expedition Zero, kelompok ekspedisi pertama yang melakukan penjelajahan ke luar Lumière. Saat ditanyakan kenapa ia tidak mengalami Gommage, Verso menjelaskan bahwa beberapa dari mereka berhenti menua pada satu titik dan entah kenapa tidak terpengaruh dengan Gommage, termasuk salah satunya adalah sang pria misterius yang ia kenalkan sebagai pemimpin Expedition Zero bernama Renoir. Alasan Renoir berkhianat dan membantai seluruh anggota ekspedisi, baik itu kelompok ekspedisi pendahulu maupun ekspedisi 33 adalah karena Renoir percaya tentang bagaimana keabadian yang ia miliki merupakan pemberian Paintress. Membunuh Paintress secara tidak langsung akan mencabut keabadian itu, yang artinya, Renoir dan Verso juga akan ikut mati. Menurut Verso, Renoir adalah orang yang egois dan ingin hidup untuk selamanya, sementara ia sendiri sudah muak memiliki keabadian setelah kehilangan orang yang ia cintai, Julie. Setelah membekali mereka dengan informasi yang sedikit memperjelas apa yang sebenarnya terjadi, Verso menawarkan bantuan, mengklaim ia bisa membantu mereka mencapai Monolith jika memang mereka tidak keberatan. Maelle yang sedari tadi menguping tiba-tiba ikut berkumpul dan mengutarakan tekadnya dalam menakhlukkan Paintress jika itu adalah satu-satunya cara untuk membunuh Renoir, membalaskan dendamnya atas kematian Gustave. Nah seperti kata Esquie sebelumnya, Verso adalah sahabatnya, sehingga disini mereka berdua sudah saling mengenal satu sama lain dan memiliki hubungan persahabatan yang akrab. Di pagi berikutnya, Verso berusaha menghibur Maelle yang masih belum bisa menerima kematian Gustave, namun Maelle tidak ingin diganggu, sehingga Verso pergi dan meletakkan buku jurnal Gustave di dekat sana. Dari titik ini kedepan, Maelle akan meneruskan isi buku jurnal Gustave secara berkala. Mengikuti bimbingan Verso, ekspedisi 33 tiba di sebuah medan tempur yang sudah lama terbengkalai, tempat mereka menemukan mayat anggota ekspedisi pendahulu tergeletak dimana-mana. Maelle mengusul agar mereka mencari tempat untuk mengubur tangan Gustave, dan Verso mengatakan bahwa ada sebuah tempat yang cukup layak untuk dijadikan sebagai area kuburan. Tempat itu terletak di sisi lain area tambang dan berada di luar pengawasan Paintress. Verso menyebutnya sebagai tempat tenang yang dilindungi banyak pepohonan. Meski Lune sebenarnya merasa keberatan karena ia ingin fokus mencapai Monolith, mereka pada akhirnya sepakat untuk menguburkan Gustave terlebih dahulu. Belum juga beranjak dari sana, mereka disambut oleh nevron Chalier, memberikan Verso kesempatan untuk menunjukkan dan sekaligus mengajari anggota ekspedisi 33 teknik bertarung yang baru, Gradient Counter. Di tengah perjalanan saat mereka hendak menyeberangi sebuah jembatan, Verso menanyakan kabar Maelle yang terlihat cemas, dan benar saja, Maelle seketika mengeluarkan seluruh emosi yang ia pendam dengan mengatakan bahwa ia tidak tahan lagi melihat kematian yang seolah mengelilingi mereka. Ia lalu mulai mempertanyakan teman-temannya yang tampak tidak peduli sama sekali dengan kematian Gustave, namun Sciel segera menenangkannya kembali, mengingatkannya untuk tetap melanjutkan perjuangan meski yang lainnya gugur. Sial tanpa sepengetahuan mereka, sesosok Nevron mengawasi dari kejauhan dan menyerang, meruntuhkan jembatan dan menjatuhkan mereka semua ke area bawah tanah, dimana disana mereka tidak memiliki pilihan lain selain menghadapi sang Nevron bernama Dualliste... Berhasil menumbangkan Dualliste, tibalah mereka di area kuburan yang dimaksud Verso, lokasi yang sangat tenang tempat Verso dulu mengubur orang yang dicintainya, Julie. Maelle menguburkan tangan Gustave di bawah pepohonan sembari berjanji akan menyelesaikan misi mereka dan membalas dendam pada Paintress dan Renoir, diikuti oleh Sciel dan Lune yang masing-masing memberikan penghormatan terakhir... Sebelum melanjutkan perjalanan, Verso mengusul agar mereka menemui temannya bernama Monoco di Monoco’s Station terlebih dahulu, mengklaim mereka akan memerlukan lebih banyak kekuatan untuk menghancurkan jantung Paintress. Saat Sciel menanyakan apa yang dimaksud oleh Verso dengan jantung Paintress, Verso menjelaskan lebih lanjut bahwa mereka tidak bisa menghadapi Paintress begitu saja karena chromanya terlalu padat untuk ditembus. Manusia bisa saja mengalami Gommage jika berada di dekatnya. Untuk itu, satu-satunya cara untuk meruntuhkan lapisan pelindung Monolith adalah dengan menghancurkan jantung Paintress. Tapi Verso sendiri mengaku tidak tahu bagaimana bentuk dari jantung Paintress, yang pasti mereka bisa menemukannya di Old Lumière, sebagian pulau Lumière yang tertinggal setelah peristiwa the Fracture terjadi. Lune dan Sciel cukup terkejut mendengar ini, baru saja menyadari bahwa rupanya memang benar, Lumière yang selama ini mereka tinggali hanyalah bagian kecil dari pulau yang jauh lebih besar sebelum the Fracture terjadi. Verso mengatakan ia pernah melakukan penjelajahan bersama beberapa kelompok ekspedisi pendahulu, salah satunya adalah dengan kelompok ekpedisi 58, dimana dalam penjelajahan itulah, ia berhasil menemukan Old Lumière. Sayang sebelum bisa menjelajah lebih jauh, mereka disergap dan dibunuh oleh Renoir. Mendengar penjelasan Verso, ekspedisi 33 sepakat untuk menemui Monoco di Monoco’s Station sebelum menghancurkan jantung Paintress di Old Lumière. Monoco adalah makhluk Gestral, tapi yang membuat Maelle penasaran adalah kenapa ia tidak tinggal di desa Gestral bersama yang lainnya. Verso memberitahu bahwa Monoco adalah Gestral tipe pencari, sehingga setelah The Fracture terjadi, ia mendedikasikan hidupnya untuk menjelajahi benua demi mencari para Gestral yang menghilang. Di titik ini, hubungan Maelle dan Verso sudah membaik, dan untuk itu, Maelle memberikan lencana miliknya sebagai bentuk peresmian Verso ke dalam kelompok ekspedisi 33. Maelle sendiri mengenakan lencana milik Gustave. Setibanya di Monoco’s Station, mereka langsung disambut oleh Monoco yang tiba-tiba menyerang Verso tapi berhasil ditangkis. Monoco dan Verso memang adalah sepasang sahabat yang sering beradu pedang... maksudnya kekuatan. Esquie juga datang untuk melepas rindu pada Monoco, menyadarkan Monoco bahwa Verso lagi-lagi melibatkannya dalam petualangan lain. Saat Lune kebingungan mendapati makhluk Gestral bisa berbicara dalam bahasa manusia, Verso memberitahu bahwa mereka berdua dulu sering menghabiskan waktu bersama, dan di saat-saat itulah, ia mengajarinya bahasa manusia. Setelah ekspedisi 33 berhadapan dengan Monoco yang hanya ingin memamerkan gaya bertarungnya, Noco si makhluk Gestral kecil berlari kencang menemui mereka untuk memperingatkan ancaman Nevron di luar. Namun karena tidak melihat Gustave, Noco menanyakan keberadaannya, membuat Maelle kembali sedih, paling tidak sebelum Verso mengalihkan perhatian Noco dengan menanyakan perihal Nevron yang ia maksud. Noco memberitahu bahwa sesosok Nevron sedang dalam perjalanan kesini, dan benar saja, tepat di luar aula, mereka segera disambut oleh nevron raksasa bernama Stalact. Di tengah pertarungan berlangsung, Monoco mengajari mereka teknik bertarung baru bernama Gradient Attack, dan setelah Stalact berhasil ditumbangkan, Monoco mengambil kakinya, memungkinkannya untuk bertansformasi menjadi sang monster. Monoco kemudian menanyakan tujuan ekspedisi 33 menemuinya, dan begitu mendengar ajakan Verso ke Old Lumière, ia langsung menolak, terutama karena mereka dulu sudah pernah pergi kesana dan berakhir dengan buruk. Verso, di sisi lain, merasa kali ini mereka pasti akan berhasil dan berusaha menyadarkan Monoco akan keberadaan Maelle, mengklaim ini adalah satu-satunya kesempatan yang mereka miliki. Melalui percakapan ini, kita tahu bahwa Verso belum sepenuhnya jujur dengan ekspedisi 33, ia diam-diam ingin memanfaatkan Maelle untuk melakukan sesuatu, dan Monoco mengerti apa yang dimaksud Verso. Tetap saja, Monoco tidak tertarik dengan apa yang diperjuangkan oleh Verso, paling tidak sebelum Verso mengingatkan bahwa perjalanan mereka akan dipenuhi dengan pertarungan... Noco juga memutuskan untuk ikut dalam perjuangan mereka, sehingga tanpa membuang banyak waktu, Monoco yang sudah sejak lama berperan sebagai sosok ayah bagi Noco, segera memimpin perjalanan menuju Old Lumière... Di tengah perjalanan saat mereka beristirahat, atas permintaan Monoco, Verso memutuskan untuk menghibur anggota ekspedisi 33 dengan trik sulapnya, memisahkan kepala dengan badan. Wow. Old Lumière, sejak the Fracture memisahkan sebagian wilayahnya, kota ini diinvasi oleh Nevron, dan seiring berjalannya waktu, menjadi rusak dan terbengkalai. Verso yakin jantung Paintress terletak di tengah-tengah kota, namun karena jalur mereka terhalang oleh bangunan besar, Monoco bertransformasi menjadi monster Stalact dan menghancurkannya, hanya untuk tidak sengaja menciptakan ledakan dahsyat yang memisahkan kelompok menjadi 2 regu. Lune terbangun bersama Sciel dan mendapati Monoco sedang menangis, merasa bersalah atas apa yang baru saja ia lakukan, namun mereka tidak ingin terlalu mempermasalahkannya dan bergegas menuju pusat kota. Di tengah perjalanan, Sciel mengungkapkan kecurigaannya terhadap Verso, berpikir Verso sepertinya menyembunyikan sesuatu dari mereka, sedangkan di sisi lain, Lune tidak terlalu curiga karena menurutnya Verso memiliki tujuan yang sama, yaitu untuk mencapai kediaman Paintress. Tapi perkataan Sciel membuatnya berpikir 2 kali, dan untuk itu, sadar Monoco adalah sahabat Verso, Lune pun bertanya, bagaimana Monoco dan Verso bertemu. Monoco mengaku tidak ingat, tapi ia membenarkan bahwa mereka memang sudah beberapa kali melakukan penjelajahan bersama kelompok ekspedisi pendahulu. Saat ditanyakan apa yang terjadi pada para anggota ekspedisi, Monoco bertingkah seolah ia tidak tahu, tidak memberikan Sciel dan Lune pilihan lain selain menanyakannya langsung pada Verso di lain kesempatan. Lune yang sedang melihat-lihat ke sekitar kemudian menemukan jurnal kelompok ekspedisi 58, ekspedisi yang dulu sempat menjelajahi Old Lumière bersama Verso, dimana begitu mempelajari isi jurnal tersebut, Lune seketika menjadi sangat terkejut mendapati kenyataan tentang Verso dan menanyakan kebenarannya pada Monoco yang hanya bisa terdiam. Sciel seketika teringat dengan Maelle yang saat ini sedang bersama Verso dan mereka pun bergegas mencarinya sebelum sesuatu yang buruk terjadi. Sementara itu, Monoco yakin Verso tidak akan menyakiti Maelle. Sudut pandang berpindah pada Maelle yang baru saja mendapatkan kembali kesadarannya. Bersama Verso dan Noco, ia bergegas pergi menuju pusat kota, namun di tengah perjalanan setelah menghadapi Nevron, Verso tiba-tiba saja menghilang entah kemana, memaksa Maelle melanjutkan pencariannya terhadap Lune dan Sciel dengan hanya ditemani oleh Noco. Menurut Noco, Verso memang sering pergi tanpa mengabari lebih dulu. Setibanya di pusat kota, perhatian Maelle langsung tertuju pada sebuah manor megah yang entah kenapa terasa familiar. Ia yakin ia tahu tempat ini, sehingga atas rasa penasaran, ia pun berjalan menuju manor tanpa menunggu teman-temannya. Pintu manor terbuka, mempertemukannya dengan sesosok wanita berambut putih dengan wajah berlubang. Namun sebelum Maelle bisa mencerna apa yang sebenarnya terjadi, Verso tiba-tiba menampakkan diri dan segera berlari ke arah Manor, mengklaim ia sudah menduga sang wanita pasti akan membukakan pintu manor untuk Maelle. Percuma saja, ledakan dahsyat mencegah Verso memasuki manor, dan di saat yang bersamaan, Renoir menampakkan diri bersama Alicia sebelum pintu manor tertutup kembali. Renoir dan Verso sekali lagi terlibat dalam perselisihan tentang masalah keluarga, dimana Renoir berusaha meyakinkan Verso bahwa ia sedang berusaha melakukan yang terbaik untuk keluarga mereka, tidak seperti Verso yang malah lebih mendambakan kematian. Maelle yang tak kuasa menahan amarah melihat pembunuh Gustave di hadapannya segera mengeluarkan senjata, bersiap membalas dendam, namun hal ini justru menyadarkan Renoir bahwa Verso masih belum mengungkapkan kebenarannya. Renoir kemudian menyebut Verso sebagai putranya, dan tepat pada saat itu, Lune, Sciel, dan Monoco melakukan serangan dadakan terhadap Renoir yang dapat dengan mudah menangkisnya. Lune mempelajari dari jurnal yang ditinggalkan ekspedisi 58 bahwa Verso adalah anak Renoir, dan untuk itu, ia meminta penjelasan. Terdesak, Verso akhirnya membenarkan hal itu, namun sebelum bisa menjelaskan perkataannya tentang bagaimana keluarga bukanlah topik pembicaraan favoritnya, secara tidak langsung menyiratkan bahwa meski Renoir adalah ayahnya, mereka tidak memilki hubungan yang baik, Renoir menghentakkan tanah, menantang ekspedisi 33 untuk menghadapinya. Renoir memiliki kemampuan bertarung yang jauh lebih unggul bila dibandingkan dengan seluruh anggota ekspedisi 33 sekaligus, dan dengan perasaan kecewa melihat Verso mengkhianati keluarganya sendiri, ia melepaskan serangan chroma dahsyat yang seketika mengguncang area sekitar. Monoco, sadar akan potensi bahaya ini, segera melindungi Noco, namun ia terlambat... Semuanya berhasil bertahan hidup dari serangan Renoir, kecuali Noco... Maelle melancarkan serangan pada Renoir berkali-kali, tapi percuma saja, Renoir yang semakin marah mendapati Maelle masih belum juga bisa menerima siapa dirinya yang sebenarnya, hendak membalas dengan serangan mematikan, hanya untuk sekali lagi dicegah oleh Verso yang menyebut Maelle sebagai Alicia. Waktu seketika membeku dan Maelle bertemu kembali dengan Alicia yang kali ini sambil menunjukkan wajah penuh bekas luka bakarnya, memberikan pengelihatan tentang insiden kebakaran manor. Saat situasi kembali normal, manor dan Renoir sudah menghilang, meninggalkan Verso dalam keadaan panik, memanggil-manggil nama Alicia dan mengungkapkan kemarahan atas kegagalannya... Lune menuntut penjelasan pada Verso tentang hubungannya dengan Renoir dan Verso segera meluruskan bahwa ia tidak lagi menganggap Renoir sebagai ayahnya. Verso tidak pernah memberitahukan hal ini sebelumnya karena ia merasa hubungan keluarganya bukan urusan mereka, ia bahkan sudah memutus hubungan keluarga dengan Renoir puluhan tahun yang lalu. Lune merasa kesal atas ketidajujuran Verso, namun Sciel segera memadamkan emosinya dengan mengingatkan bahwa selama ini Verso benar-benar berusaha mengarahkan mereka ke jalan yang benar, sehingga terlepas dari kebohongan Verso, Lune, Sciel, dan Maelle pada akhirnya sepakat untuk tetap bekerjasama dengannya. Monoco kemudian berkumpul bersama mereka sambil membawa semacam tabung Gestral yang adalah tubuh dari Noco. Ketika makhluk Gestral mati, mereka tidak benar-benar meninggalkan dunia, melainkan akan mengalami proses reinkarnasi. Tapi meski begitu, Gestral yang bangkit kembali tidak akan benar-benar sama seperti dirinya yang dulu, Noco tidak akan ingat dengan apa yang terjadi di masa lalu. Dan inilah yang membuat Monoco sedih. Verso turut berduka atas kematian Noco dan meminta maaf pada mereka semua atas perjuangan yang berakhir sia-sia, mengklaim mereka sebenarnya bisa menemukan jantung Paintress di dalam manor, tapi manor malah menghilang sebelum mereka bisa memasukinya. Di saat semuanya tampak sudah kehilangan harapan, Lune teringat dengan jurnal yang ditinggalkan oleh kelompok ekspedisi 58, merinci tentang cara lain untuk mengalahkan Paintress. Dalam jurnalnya, ekspedisi 58 berbicara tentang bagaimana ada kemungkinan The Curator bisa membuatkan senjata khusus yang dapat menembus lapisan pelindung Monolith, namun untuk membuat senjata itu, diperlukan jantung dari Axon, monster yang jauh lebih kuat dari Nevron. Verso dan Renoir sempat menghabiskan waktu mereka selama bertahun-tahun untuk membunuh Axon, tapi selalu berakhir gagal. Nah karena kegagalannya di masa lalu, Verso tidak menyarankan mereka menggunakan cara ini, tapi sepertinya sekarang mereka tidak lagi memiliki pilihan lain, sehingga eksepdisi 33 mencoba menemui The Curator dan meminta bantuannya dalam membuatkan senjata khusus yang dapat menembus lapisan pelindung Monolith. The Curator bereaksi ketika Lune menyebut soal jantung Axon, dan Verso lanjut menjelaskan bahwa mereka memerlukan chroma murni dalam jumlah yang besar untuk menciptakan senjata, yang dimana chroma murni hanya bisa didapatkan dari dalam tubuh Axon dan ia tidak yakin mereka bisa mengalahkan Axon semudah itu. Axon jauh lebih kuat dan berbahaya dari Nevron, bahkan Verso yang memiliki keabadian pun tidak bisa menumbangkan mereka. Mendengar penjelasan Verso, Lune teringat dengan salah satu Axon bernama Hauler yang mereka temukan di Old Lumière dalam keadaan tidak bernyawa, yang artinya, ada seseorang yang berhasil menakhlukkannya. Verso tidak tahu siapa yang membunuhnya, tapi ia memperingatkan bahwa menghadapi Axon bukanlah keputusan yang tepat jika mereka tidak ingin mati. Lune bersikeras ingin menjalankan rencana ini, karena lagipula cepat atau lambat mereka juga akan direnggut oleh kematian. Sadar ia tidak mungkin bisa menghentikan tekad ekspedisi 33, Verso memberitahu strategi terbaik untuk menghadapi Axon. Axon dapat ditemukan di pulau-pulau yang terletak cukup dekat dengan Monolith. Dengan kematian Axon Hauler, kini hanya tersisa 3 Axon, namun kabar baiknya, mereka hanya perlu 2 jantung Axon untuk mendapatkan chroma murni yang cukup dalam pembuatan senjata. Satu di antara ketiga Axon tinggal di daerah pegunungan yang terlalu jauh dari sini, sehingga mereka tidak mungkin mengincar yang satu itu. Verso menyarankan agar mereka menghadapi Axon yang ada di sebelah barat Monolith terlebih dahulu, mengklaim Axon itu sudah dilemahkan oleh para ekspedisi pendahulu. Baru setelahnya, mereka pergi ke pulau di sebelah timur Monolith untuk menghadapi Axon lainnya... Sebelum berangkat, Maelle menanyakan tentang Alicia yang terungkap sebagai saudari Verso, dimana disini Verso memberitahu bahwa Alicia dulu terjebak dalam insiden kebakaran yang merusak wajah dan tenggorokannya. Eksepdisi 33 berangkat menuju pulau Visages yang terletak di sebelah barat Monolith, pulau yang dipenuhi dengan wajah dimana-mana. Di tengah upaya pencarian Axon, mereka disambut oleh Mask Keeper yang mengatakan bahwa mereka semua diundang oleh Visages untuk menemuinya di jalur utama. Ekspedisi 33 sadar ada total 4 jalur yang bisa mereka tempuh, 3 di antaranya adalah jalur sampingan untuk menghadapi monster topeng sedih, topeng marah, dan topeng bahagia. Jika eksepdisi 33 memutuskan untuk menakhlukkan ketiga topeng ini terlebih dahulu, maka Axon Visages akan melemah, memperbesar peluang keberhasilan mereka. Berhasil menakhlukkan Visages, mereka lagi-lagi dihampiri oleh Mask Keeper yang mengungkapkan dirinya sebagai Axon yang asli. Kenyataannya, ialah yang mengendalikan Visages. Situasi ini tidak memberikan ekspedisi 33 pilihan lain selain menyiapkan diri untuk bertarung sekali lagi, dan memang benar, Axon bukanlah musuh yang bisa dipandang sebelah mata, karena dalam pertarungan ini, ekspedisi 33 nyaris saja gugur saat Mask Keeper melancarkan satu serangan terakhir dengan memaksa setiap dari mereka mengenakan topeng. Verso, Lune, dan Maelle kesulitan menghadapi serangan ini. Monoco tidak terpengaruh karena ia tidak memiliki wajah, tapi yang mengejutkan adalah Sciel sama sekali tidak terpengaruh dan bahkan bisa melepas topeng yang menutupi wajahnya dengan mudah. Sebelum yang lainnya mati, Sciel segera melepas topeng Mask Keeper, seketika menakhlukkannya... Bagaimana bisa Sciel tidak terpengaruh oleh serangan Mask Keeper? Perlu diketahui, Axon adalah monster yang diciptakan berdasarkan kelemahan manusia. Mask Keeper mewakili sifat alami manusia yang sering dalam tanda kutip “menggunakan topeng” dalam kehidupan mereka. Dengan kata lain, tidak menjadi diri mereka sendiri. Sedangkan Sciel, setelah mengalami pahitnya kehidupan ditinggal mati oleh sang suami dan hampir saja mengakhiri hidup, ia belajar untuk menjadi seseorang yang jujur dengan dirinya sendiri dan orang lain. Di sepanjang game, kalian bisa melihat bagaimana Sciel adalah orang yang paling dewasa di antara mereka semua. Dan karena inilah, ia tidak terpengaruh oleh kekuatan Mask Keeper. Topeng Mask Keeper adalah jantung yang mereka perlukan, namun saat semuanya sudah beranjak pergi, Verso membisikkan sesuatu... Ekspedisi 33 kembali menemui The Curator yang secara spesifik menginginkan Maelle untuk memberikan topeng Mask Keeper padanya, dimana tepat di saat Maelle memberikan topeng tersebut, ia sekilas mendapatkan pengelihatan tentang sosok Renoir. Verso tampak tidak terkejut dan memberitahu bahwa ia juga sering melihat Renoir di mimpinya. Jelas ada sesuatu yang disembunyikan oleh Verso. Tapi di sisi lain, Verso sudah menjalin hubungan yang sangat baik dengan Maelle sampai pada titik dimana Maelle menganggapnya sebagai sosok pengganti Gustave. Bahkan ia menyempatkan diri untuk memainkan piano bersama Maelle dan tertawa bersama... Di hari berikutnya, Ekspedisi 33 mencapai pulau di sebelah timur Monolith yang mempertemukan mereka dengan Axon kedua bernama Sirène. Sirène tampak sedang menari dan bernyanyi, namun nyanyiannya yang sangat merdu seketika menghipnotis seluruh anggota ekspedisi 33, membuat mereka merasakan perasaan gembira hingga ikut menari-nari. Monoco yang tidak terpengaruh segera menyadarkan teman-temannya, mengatakan Sirène sedang berusaha memanipulasi emosi mereka dan mengingatkan tujuan utama mereka datang kesini. Maelle entah kenapa merasa familiar dengan tarian Sirène. Setelah menempuh perjalanan panjang penuh Nevron dan menakhlukkan beberapa bawahan Sirène seperti Tisseur dan Glissando, bertemulah mereka dengan Sirène, tempat Maelle sekali lagi mengatakan bahwa ia benar-benar merasa familiar dengan tariannya. Sirène memanipulasi emosi mereka dengan memberikan Lune pengelihatan atas kedua orang tuanya yang gagal dalam ekspedisi 46, Maelle dengan pengelihatan atas Gustave, Sciel dengan pengelihatan atas suaminya, Pierre yang sedang menggendong bayi mereka, dan Monoco dengan pengelihatan atas Noco. Namun ia kesulitan membaca emosi Verso, dan dalam kemarahannya, ia tidak sengaja menarik kekuatan manipulasi, seketika mengembalikan kesadaran seluruh anggota ekspedisi 33 yang segera bersiap menghadapinya. Kemungkinan alasan Sirène gagal memanipulasi emosi Verso adalah karena Verso sudah bisa menerima kematian atas orang yang dicintainya, Julie. Berhasil melemahkan Sirène, Lune yang sudah belajar untuk mengendalikan emosinya agar tidak terpengaruh oleh nyanyian sang Axon, melancarkan serangan terakhir yang langsung menumbangkan Sirène, memberikan mereka jantung Axon kedua berupa kain Sirène... Maelle memberikan kain Sirène pada The Curator, dimana kali ini ia sekilas dipindahkan ke alam lain tempat semua temannya membeku dan bertemu sekali lagi dengan sosok wanita berambut putih yang menyerangnya... Saat situasi sudah kembali normal, The Curator memanfaatkan chroma murni yang mereka kumpulkan dari Axon untuk membuat senjata khusus bernama Barrier Breaker dan memberikannya pada Maelle. Ini adalah senjata yang bisa digunakan untuk menghancurkan lapisan pelindung Monolith, meninggalkan ekspedisi 33 hanya dengan satu langkah terakhir, yaitu mencapai Monolith. Malam itu saat Verso sedang menyendiri sementara yang lainnya merayakan kemenangan dengan minum-minum, ia dihampiri oleh Alicia saudarinya yang memberikan sebuah surat. Verso lalu membuka topeng yang menutupi wajah Alicia dan memeluknya, namun di tengah pertemuan ini, Renoir menampakkan diri dan mengatakan bahwa keputusan Verso dalam membantu ekspedisi 33 menghadapi Paintress hanya akan membunuh Alicia. Renoir mengaku datang bukan untuk memulai pertarungan, melainkan untuk memberikan peringatan terakhir akan konsekuensi fatal yang bisa terjadi bila Verso terus melanjutkan perjuangannya ini. Bukan hanya keluarga mereka yang akan mati, melainkan juga anggota ekspedisi 33 dan semua orang yang ada di Lumière. Semua orang yang masih hidup, mereka yang menghabiskan waktu bersama orang terdekatnya atau sekedar menjalani hidup normal, masih ada karena kehendak Paintress, tapi Verso malah ingin menghancurkan semua itu... Perjuangan panjang ekspedisi 33 akhirnya terbayarkan ketika mereka mencapai lapisan pelindung Monolith dan menghancurkannya dengan menggunakan Barrier Breaker... Menara Monolith sudah sangat dekat dan Verso hanya bisa menatap Paintress yang sedang menjaga jalan masuk menara dengan tatapan penuh kesedihan. Ia tahu mereka harus menghadapinya, tapi aneh tiap serangan yang mereka lancarkan tidak memberikan efek sama sekali dan Paintress tidak membalas satupun serangan itu. Kelalahan, ekspedisi 33 menghentikan serangan mereka, dan ketika Maelle baru saja menyadari bahwa sosok raksasa yang ada di hadapan mereka bukanlah Paintress, ia lagi-lagi mendapatkan pengelihatan tentang wanita berambut putih yang berdiri di kejauhan. Kali ini, seluruh anggota ekspedisi juga diseret masuk ke dalam pengelihatan Maelle, namun sebelum Maelle bisa menggapainya, seluruh wajah mereka mulai terbakar, kecuali Verso dan Monoco. Verso tidak bisa melakukan apa-apa selain memeluk erat Maelle, dan bersamaan dengan situasi sekitar yang kembali normal, sosok wanita berambut putih membukakan jalan masuk menuju menara Monolith untuk mereka. Mencapai bagian dalam Monolith, mereka diseret masuk ke dalam memori masa lalu seorang wanita, dimulai dari sang wanita yang sedang melukis, mengajari kedua anaknya untuk melukis, duduk di sebuah bangku bersama sang suami, terlibat dalam perselisihan dengan anak perempuannya, mengajari anak laki-lakinya cara bermain piano, hingga menghabiskan waktu berdua bersama sang suami. Anehnya Verso menjadi sangat diam di sepanjang perjalanan ini, dan tiap kali seseorang menanyakan kenapa ia menjadi sangat diam, Verso menolak memberitahu. Perjalanan mereka kemudian terhenti ketika Renoir menampakkan diri di sebuah aula dan memberitahu Verso bahwa bukan hanya Paintress yang berduka atas kepergian Verso, melainkan juga dirinya. Tapi tetap saja, Renoir tidak berhasil meyakinkan Verso untuk menghentikan perjuangannya, dan pertarungan pun tak terhindarkan... Di sepanjang pertarungan berlangsung, Renoir kerap kali berusaha mengingatkan Verso atas kehidupannya sebelum semua ini terjadi dan mengatakan bahwa saudari Verso, Alicia, pantas mendapatkan kehidupan yang lebih layak. Saat terluka cukup parah, ia memanggil Dark Creature berwujud singa yang dapat menyembuhkan dan sekaligus membantunya menghadapi Ekspedisi 33. Meski begitu, Ekspedisi 33 tetap bisa mengungguli pertarungan dan pada akhirnya berhasil melumpuhkan Renoir. Maelle yang masih menyimpan dendam atas kematian Gustave segera menghampiri Renoir dan menebasnya, meninggalkannya dalam keadaan terluka parah. Namun secara mengejutkan, Renoir masih bisa menyembuhkan diri dan mengeluarkan energi ledakan, sebelum kemudian ia berusaha mengingatkan Verso untuk berpihak pada keluarga aslinya, keluarga Dessendre. Sadar ia tidak mungkin bisa mengubah pemikiran Verso, Renoir mengupayakan serangan terakhir, namun ia segera menghentikannya ketika menyadari keberadaan The Curator yang datang menghampirinya. Renoir menyebut The Curator sebagai ayah Verso dan memberitahu bahwa menakhlukkan The Paintress tidak akan mengembalikan istrinya. The Curator tidak mengucapkan sepatah kata pun, melainkan ia membimbing tangan Maelle untuk bersama-sama menakhlukkan Renoir... Sciel menanyakan apa yang dimaksud Renoir tentang hubungan Verso dengan The Curator, tapi Verso berpura-pura tidak tahu. Kini dengan kematian Renoir, hanya ada satu pintu yang memisahkan mereka dengan Paintress.. Disinilah terungkap bahwa rupanya sosok wanita berambut putih yang menampakkan diri di pengelihatan Maelle belakangan ini adalah Paintress itu sendiri. Wujud Paintress mengingatkan mereka dengan The Curator, sehingga mereka menebak Paintress sebagai istri The Curator yang dimaksud oleh Renoir. Paintress menyambut kehadiran Maelle dengan penuh kebahagiaan, namun melihat wajah Maelle yang tidak meninggalkan bekas luka bakar, ia seketika tersadar bahwa Maelle bukanlah orang yang ia cari dan menyalahkan Renoir atas tipu daya ini. Lune dan Sciel segera memahami apa yang terjadi, Paintress salah mengira Maelle sebagai putrnya, Alicia, yang wajahnya terbakar dalam suatu insiden kebakaran. Paintress tidak ingin terlalu mempermasalahkan hal ini dan mengajak Verso untuk pulang bersamanya, tapi mendengar penolakan Verso, ia menjadi semakin yakin bahwa ini semua adalah tipu daya yang diciptakan oleh Renoir, sehingga atas kemarahannya, ia pun berusaha membunuh Ekspedisi 33, memulai pertarungan sengit. Di sepanjang pertarungan berlangsung, Paintress kerap kali mengutarakan kekecewaannya terhadap Renoir yang malah menggunakan kemampuan melukis yang ia ajarkan padanya untuk melawan dirinya. Namun meski Paintress sudah dibantu oleh Puppet raksasa dan kekuatannya jauh melampaui Renoir, Ekspedisi 33 berhasil melemahkannya sampai pada titik dimana Paintress hanya bisa tersungkur jatuh di hadapan mereka. Kali ini setiap serangan yang dilancarkan ekspedisi 33 tidak dibalas dengan serangan lainnya, melainkan malah dibalas dengan penyembuhan. Paintress kemudian bangkit berdiri dan mati di pelukan putranya, Verso... Saat Maelle mendekat, Paintress memanggilnya sebagai Alicia... Semuanya sudah selesai. Dengan kematian Paintress, angka di Monolith yang selama ini menjadi kutukan bagi warga Lumière menghilang. Maelle menancapkan bendera Ekspedisi 33 yang menandai akhir perjalanan mereka sebelum kelimanya bergegas pulang menuju Lumière dengan bantuan Esquie. Kepulangan Ekspedisi 33 disambut dengan sangat meriah oleh seluruh warga Lumière yang kini tidak harus menjalani kehidupan dengan rasa takut lagi. Semuanya bergembira, Lune bertemu kembali dengan temannya, anak-anak kagum melihat makhluk Gestral bersama Sciel, Maelle melihat ke arah Monolith untuk memastikan semuanya sudah benar-benar berakhir, dan Esquie menari menghibur anak-anak disana. Namun di balik kegembiraan ini, ada perasaan kecewa dan sedih yang terukir dalam diri murid Gustave dan Emma. Maelle hanya bisa meminta maaf dan mengembalikan buku harian pemberian sang murid yang sudah terisi. Kecewa, sang murid membuang buku harian Gustave dan pergi meninggalkan mereka. Verso di sisi lain meghabiskan waktu sendirian di tepi pulau untuk membaca surat pemberian Alicia. Melalui suratnya, Alicia mengatakan bahwa ia sudah lelah dengan konflik keluarga dan tipu daya yang terjadi di antara mereka tanpa henti, dan untuk itu, ia sudah memutuskan untuk berdamai dengan apapun yang akan terjadi di masa depan. Ia sebenarnya merasa iri dengan Maelle, melihat wajahnya yang tidak meninggalkan bekas luka bakar dan bisa tertawa bersama Verso saudaranya. Seharusnya seperti itulah dirinya yang asli, tidak seperti wujud yang digambarkan dalam versi lukisan atas dirinya ini. Setelah mengungkapkan seluruh perasaannya, Alicia menyampaikan sesuatu yang sangat mengejutkan, dunia tempat mereka berada saat ini hanyalah semacam cermin yang diciptakan oleh ibu mereka, The Paintress, demi melupakan perasaan dukanya. Paintress selalu melihat ekspedisi sebagai suatu ancaman yang akan menjerumuskan keluarga mereka ke dalam jurang. Di sisi lain, ada seseorang yang berusaha menghadapi Paintress sendirian, seseorang yang memulai peristiwa Gommage yang dilakukan atas dasar cinta. Orang itu sangat mencintai Paintress dan dia adalah ayah Verso, Renoir. Angka yang terlukis di Monolith adalah bentuk peringatan yang sengaja ditinggalkan oleh Paintress karena ia secara perlahan mulai kehilangan kekuatannya. Alicia kemudian menyimpulkan bahwa Paintress ingin semua orang tetap hidup, berlawanan dengan Renoir yang tidak percaya akan hal itu, sehingga sementara Paintress melukis kehidupan, Renoir melukis kematian. Tepat setelah Verso membuang surat Alicia ke laut, gelombang dahsyat datang dari arah Monolith, kembali menyelimuti dunia dengan kegelapan dan memulai peristiwa Gommage... Ini adalah akhir dari Act 2 yang malah menimbulkan semakin banyak pertanyaan. Untuk itu di segmen berikutnya, kami akan fokus menjelaskan apa yang sebenarnya terjadi di balik semua ini. Melalui surat pemberian Alicia, terungkap bahwa rupanya di sepanjang game berlangsung, kita ditempatkan dalam sudut pandang orang-orang yang tinggal di dalam dunia lukisan alias dunia palsu ciptaan The Paintress. Tapi kalau begitu, apa yang terjadi di realita, apa yang menyebabkan Gommage, apa yang terjadi di antara keluarga Dessendre, dan yang paling penting adalah apa yang mengawali semua ini? Untuk menjawab seluruh pertanyaan itu, kami akan menjelaskan runtut dimulai dari peristiwa yang mengawali semua ini. Dalam dunia Clair Obscur, dikisahkan bahwa di luar dunia lukisan alias di realita, sedang terjadi perang antar 2 Faksi, Faksi Penulis atau ‘Writer’ dan Faksi Pelukis atau ‘Painter’. Nah kita akan mengikuti kisah dari salah satu keluarga pelukis elit, yaitu keluarga Dessendre yang mengalami konflik internal hingga menyebabkan masalah berkepanjangan seperti yang dikisahkan di sepanjang game. Keluarga Dessendre terdiri dari sepasang suami istri bernama Renoir dan Aline, dan mereka memiliki 3 anak, masing-masing bernama Clea, Verso, dan Alicia. Mereka semua adalah pelukis, dan dalam dunia Clair Obscur, Faksi pelukis memiliki kekuatan untuk menghidupkan karya, bukan hanya sebuah metafora, melainkan benar-benar menciptakan dunia baru di dalam kanvas tempat makhluk ciptaan mereka tinggal dan berkembang biak. Para pelukis juga bisa memproyeksikan kesadaran mereka ke dalam dunia lukisan untuk bermain di dalam sana atau sekedar menghabiskan waktu, menjadikan kanvas sebagai semacam pintu portal menuju dunia lain. Aline, ibu dari keluarga Dessendre, sudah menguasai teknik melukis dengan sangat baik, sehingga ia menjabat sebagai Ketua Dewan Pelukis dan mengajari suaminya, Renoir, cara melukis yang aman agar mereka terhindar dari bahaya yang bisa saja mengancam nyawa. Mereka berdua kemudian membesarkan 3 anak, Clea, Verso, dan Alicia, dan mengajari mereka semua untuk menjadi seorang pelukis terlepas dari bagaimana masing-masing dari mereka sebenarnya memiliki ketertarikan yang berbeda. Clea memang memiliki ketertarikan khusus dalam melukis, tapi tidak dengan kedua adiknya, Verso dan Alicia, yang meski juga memiliki ketertarikan dalam melukis, mereka sebenarnya memiliki ketertarikan lain yang lebih mereka senangi. Verso, sejak ibunya mengajari cara bermain piano, ia merasa lebih senang bermain musik daripada melukis, tapi apa boleh buat, ia dipaksa mengikuti jejak kedua orang tuanya untuk menjadi seorang pelukis. Sedangkan Alicia, berbeda dengan kedua saudaranya, ia lebih senang menulis daripada melukis. Bahkan dari sekian banyaknya lukisan yang ia ciptakan, hanya satu lukisan kecil yang dianggap layak oleh ibunya, Aline, untuk dipajang di dinding kediaman mereka, sangat kontras dengan lukisan keluarganya yang lain. Nah sejak kecil, baik Clea, Verso, maupun Alicia, sudah diberikan kebebasan untuk menciptakan dunia lukisan mereka sendiri, dan salah satu dunia lukisan yang nantinya akan menjadi setting utama dalam game Clair Obscur adalah dunia lukisan ciptaan Verso. Sejak kecil, Verso sudah menuangkan kreativitasnya ke dalam kanvas untuk menciptakan dunia lukisan yang benar-benar indah dan magis, dunia dimana kita bisa menelusuri area hutan yang terasa mistis, lautan tempat ikan beterbangan di udara, sebuah desa yang dipenuhi dengan pepohonan merah tempat makhluk Gestral berdiam, goa bawah tanah yang menjadi sarang kediaman Esquie, stasiun kereta di area bersalju tempat Monoco berdiam, dan lain sebagainya. Seluruh lokasi yang kita kunjungi di sepanjang game Clair Obscur adalah ciptaan Verso, dan semua itu ia ciptakan melalui imajinasinya yang tetap berdasar pada apa yang ada di realita. Misalnya saja karakter Noco si Gestral kecil dan Monoco sahabat Verso, didasarkan dari 2 anjing peliharaannya bernama Noco dan Monoco the Third. Sementara itu, Esquie ia dasarkan pada lukisan keluarganya yang terpajang di dinding manor. Clea tidak jarang menghabiskan waktu untuk bermain bersama Verso di dalam kanvas milik adiknya itu, dimana disana mereka bersama-sama memperluas dunia lukisan dengan menciptakan benua luas atau yang biasa dikenal dengan sebutan The Continent. Disana Clea juga biasanya bereksperimen menciptakan makhluk bernama Nevron yang sebagian besar berakhir gagal, sehingga ia malah tidak sengaja menciptakan White Nevron atau Unfinished Nevron, Nevron yang tidak bersifat agresif terhadap kelompok ekspedisi. Seiring berjalannya waktu, Clea, Verso, dan Alicia mulai mempelajari bahwa mereka sebenarnya dipersiapkan untuk menjadi seorang pelukis bukan tanpa alasan, melainkan untuk memastikan kemenangan Faksi Pelukis yang sedang berperang melawan Faksi Penulis. Sama dengan Faksi Pelukis, Faksi Penulis juga memiliki kekuatan untuk menghidupkan karya mereka, tapi tentu dengan cara menulis. Nah apa yang terjadi berikutnya masih abu-abu, tidak ada yang tahu secara pasti, tapi yang kita ketahui adalah bahwa Alicia yang sudah menginjak usia remaja dan masih memiliki ketertarikan dalam menulis melakukan suatu kesalahan fatal yang menyebabkan pada insiden kebakaran manor tempat Keluarga Dessendre berdiam. Insiden ini membahayakan nyawanya sendiri, dan Verso tanpa ragu menyelamatkan nyawa Alicia, meski itu artinya ia berakhir kehilangan nyawa. Alicia selamat dengan kondisi mengalami luka serius pada bagian wajah dan tenggorokan, membuatnya kehilangan kemampuan berbicara... Ada teori yang mengatakan bahwa insiden kebakaran ini berawal dari keinginan Alicia untuk menjadi seorang penulis bukan pelukis, mengingat ia lebih senang menulis. Untuk mengasah kemampuan menulisnya, ia berteman dengan salah satu anggota Faksi Penulis, namun pada suatu hari, saat ia sedang mencoba menggunakan kemampuan menulisnya yang belum sempurna, ia malah tidak sengaja menciptakan api yang kemudian memulai insiden kebakaran manor. Apapun yang terjadi, Clea menyalahkan Faksi Penulis atas insiden kebakaran tersebut. Dan kematian Verso akan menjadi akar masalah dari apa yang terjadi berikutnya. Aline, ibu dari keluarga Dessendre, adalah orang yang paling berduka atas kematian Verso, sehingga berbeda dengan Renoir yang berusaha untuk sebisa mungkin segera menerima kematian putranya dan melanjutkan hidup seperti biasa, Aline yang masih tidak bisa menerima kematian putranya malah memutuskan untuk menghabiskan kebanyakan waktunya di dalam dunia lukisan ciptaan Verso dan mulai mengucilkan diri dari keluarganya sendiri. Ia mengaku tidak tahan hidup di realita, terutama saat ia melihat bekas luka bakar di wajah Alicia yang hanya akan mengingatkannya kembali pada rasa sakit atas kehilangan Verso. Situasi ini memaksa Clea untuk menggantikan posisi ibunya sebagai pemimpin keluarga Dessendre yang harus memastikan kemenangan Faksi Pelukis atas Faksi Penulis. Sementara itu, Renoir mulai menganggap obsesi Aline sebagai sesuatu yang kurang sehat, terutama karena ia merasa hubungan keluarga Dessendre semakin lama menjadi semakin renggang sejak Aline menguclikan diri. Tapi tidak sampai disana, pada satu titik, obsesi Aline semakin menjadi-jadi ketika ia menyadari bahwa ia masih bisa menemukan sedikit jiwa Verso di dalam dunia lukisannya. Jiwa Verso tidak lain adalah bayang-bayang anak kecil, disebut Young Boy, yang beberapa kali menampakkan diri di sepanjang perjalanan. Inilah kenapa Young Boy kerap kali berbicara tentang bagaimana ia rindu tertawa bersama yang lainnya dan bahkan sempat berusaha menyebut nama Renoir dan Clea. Ia juga berbicara tentang kesukaannya terhadap kereta api, yang dimana justru karena inilah, Verso menciptakan lokasi bernama Monoco’s Station yang dipenuhi rel kereta api. Nah atas penemuan ini, Aline bertekad untuk melindungi kanvas milik Verso apapun yang terjadi dan mulai menciptakan versi lukisan atas keluarganya sendiri di dalam sana. Ia melukis Renoir, Clea, Verso, dan Alicia, dan mengimbuhi mereka dengan keabadian, berharap ia bisa menghabiskan waktu bersama keluarganya yang masih utuh untuk selamanya. Perlu diketahui, waktu dalam dunia lukisan tidak berjalan sama dengan waktu di realita. Seesorang bisa saja menghabiskan waktu selama bertahun-tahun dalam dunia lukisan, tapi kenyataannya, ia hanya menghabiskan sedikit waktu di realita. Versi lukisan dari setiap anggota Keluarga Dessendre ditempatkan oleh Aline di sebuah pulau bernama Lumière yang kemudian ia isi dengan populasi manusia, membuat dunia lukisan tampak benar-benar hidup dan mendekati realita. Manusia-manusia yang berdiam di dunia lukisan, termasuk versi lukisan dari setiap anggota keluarga Dessendre bahkan tidak tahu bahwa mereka sebenarnya adalah makhluk yang tercipta dari kuas dan cat. Yang mereka ketahui hanyalah bahwa chroma merupakan semacam energi yang memberikan mereka sumber kehidupan. Untuk membedakan versi asli dari suatu karakter dengan versi lukisannya, kita akan menambahkan kata “Painted” di depan nama karakter versi lukisan. Jadi Painted Renoir adalah versi lukisan dari Renoir, Painted Verso adalah versi lukisan dari Verso, Painted Clea dari Clea, dan Painted Alicia dari Alicia, sedangkan Aline sendiri dikenal sebagai Paintress di dunia lukisan. Aline menciptakan versi lukisan dari setiap anggota keluarganya bukan berdasarkan sifat asli mereka, melainkan berdasarkan bagaimana ia melihat mereka. Manor yang menjadi kediaman keluarga Dessendre juga ia lukis ke dalam dunia lukisan... Peradaban di dunia lukisan berjalan selama bertahun-tahun dengan penuh perdamaian, paling tidak sebelum peristiwa The Fracture terjadi, memisahkan sebagian pulau Lumière ke lautan lepas dan peristiwa yang menandai dimulainya kutukan Gommage. Apa yang terjadi di balik itu? Semua ini terjadi karena keterlibatan Renoir. Merasa bertanggung jawab atas masalah yang terjadi di keluarganya, ia bertekad untuk mengeluarkan Aline dari kanvas milik Verso sebelum menghancurkan kanvas tersebut, berpikir keputusan Aline dalam memulai kehidupan baru di dunia lukisan sudah terlalu berlebihan. Saat Renoir memproyeksikan dirinya ke dalam kanvas milik Verso, ia langsung terlibat konflik dengan Aline yang berlangsung selama puluhan tahun, dimana pertarungan dahsyat ini menciptakan celah retakan yang memulai peristiwa The Fracture, melemparkan sebagian pulau Lumière ke lautan lepas. Selain itu dalam upaya mengalahkan Aline, Renoir juga menciptakan 4 monster Axon yang ia dasarkan pada keluarganya. Axon bernama Hauler mewakili Clea, The Reacher mewakili Alicia, Mask Keeper mewakili Verso, dan Sirène mewakili Aline. Sayangnya upaya Renoir dalam mengeluarkan Aline dari kanvas berakhir gagal ketika Aline mendirikan menara batu Monolith dan memenjarakan Renoir di bawahnya. Sebagai upaya terakhir, Renoir mulai menghapus seluruh makhluk ciptaan Aline secara perlahan melalui Gommage, peristiwa yang nantinya dikenal sebagai kutukan oleh warga Lumière. Sementara itu, Aline yang terperangkap di bagian atas Monolith, berusaha mencari cara menghentikan Gommage dan memberikan peringatan bagi seluruh warga Lumière melalui angka yang terus berkurang di Monolith, dimulai dari angka 100. Warga Lumière tidak mengerti apa yang sebenarnya terjadi dan mengirim kelompok ekspedisi pertama untuk mencari tahu, kelompok ekspedisi yang dikenal dengan sebutan Expedition Zero. Expedition Zero dipimpin oleh Painted Renoir dan diikuti oleh 2 anggota keluarganya, yaitu Painted Verso dan Painted Clea. Tujuan mereka melakukan ekspedisi ini bukan hanya untuk mencari tahu apa yang sebenarnya terjadi, melainkan juga untuk mencari Aline yang menghilang setelah The Fracture terjadi, mengingat Aline terlibat dalam pertarungan dengan Renoir dan berakhir terkurung di Monolith. Sementara itu 2 di antara banyaknya warga Lumière yang juga ikut bergabung ke dalam Expedition Zero adalah Simon dan Julie. Simon menjalin hubungan dengan Painted Clea, sedangkan Julie menjalin hubungan dengan Painted Verso. Di realita, Clea, anak tertua dari keluarga Dessendre yang lebih memihak sisi ayahnya, Renoir, memutuskan untuk ikut campur dengan menciptakan monster Nevron dan menyebarkannya ke dalam dunia lukisan, sediikt demi sedikit mengurangi kekuatan Aline. Ia lalu menculik versi lukisan atas dirinya sendiri, yaitu Painted Clea dan mengubah tujuan hidupnya untuk menciptakan Nevron terus menerus tanpa henti. Clea adalah satu-satunya pelukis di Keluarga Dessendre yang memiliki kemampuan untuk melukis ulang makhluk ciptaan orang lain, menjelaskan kenapa ia bisa dengan mudah mengubah tujuan Painted Clea. Setelah mengurung Painted Clea di tempat yang tersembunyi dan tidak mudah digapai, Clea memanipulasi Simon dengan membisikinya kebohongan, mengatakan bahwa Painted Clea telah mengkhianatinya dan bahwa Simon telah dipilih untuk memulihkan keseimbangan dunia. Karena Simon sedang dalam suasana duka atas menghilangnya Painted Clea, ia menjadi mudah untuk dimanipulasi. Clea mengimbuhinya kekuatan untuk menakhlukkan Axon, dan dengan demikian, Axon pertama bernama Hauler pun mati di tangan Simon. Tapi kenapa Clea malah mengimbuhi Simon dengan kekuatan untuk menghancurkan Axon, padahal Axon adalah monster ciptaan Renoir? Kematian Axon melepaskan sejumlah chroma murni dari dalam tubuh mereka yang bisa Clea gunakan untuk melemahkan penjara Renoir. Sebelum meninggalkan dunia lukisan, Clea melakukan satu upaya terakhir, yaitu menampakkan diri di hadapan Expedition Zero tepat di luar lapisan pelindung Monolith, dimana disana ia mengungkapkan seluruh kebenaran yang terjadi pada mereka, tentang bagaimana mereka adalah makhluk yang diciptakan di dunia lukisan milik Verso yang sudah mati, tentang peristiwa The Fracture, dan tentang insiden kebakaran Manor yang memulai seluruh konflik ini. Clea memperingatkan Expedition Zero untuk jangan ikut campur dengan urusan Renoir dan Aline, namun saat mereka menolak, ia langsung melakukan pembantaian besar-besaran yang berakhir membunuh sebagian besar anggota Expedition Zero. Painted Verso dan Painted Renoir ikut terbunuh dalam pembantaian ini, membuat Julie, salah satu anggota Expedition Zero yang menjalin hubungan dengan Painted Verso, ketakutan tidak main. Namun tak lama berselang, Julie dibuat terkejut ketika ia mendapati Painted Verso bangkit kembali seolah tidak ada yang terjadi padanya. Ingat, Aline telah memberikan keabadian pada versi lukisan dari setiap anggota keluarga Dessendre, sehingga Painted Verso, Painted Renoir, Painted Alicia, dan Painted Clea adalah makhluk abadi yang tidak bisa mati atau menua di dunia lukisan. Painted Verso mencoba berbohong dan tidak ingin terlalu membesar-besarkan apa yang baru saja terjadi, namun Julie tidak percaya dan malah menjadi curiga bahwa Painted Verso dan Painted Renoir telah mengkhianati dan membunuh seluruh anggota Expedition Zero. Untuk itu dengan bantuan rekan satu timnya bernama Claude, Louise, dan Dion, Julie menangkap Painted Verso dan menginterogasinya untuk mendapatkan jawaban. Di situasi seperti ini, Painted Verso tidak memiliki pilihan lain selain membunuh Julie dan rekan timnya, yang dimana ini adalah tindakan yang sangat ia sesali. Dalam jurnalnya, Painted Verso mengatakan bahwa ia tidak bisa memberitahukan kebenarannya pada Julie karena ia tahu Julie tidak mungkin mempercayainya. Di saat-saat seperti itu, Painted Renoir juga memanipulasinya dengan mengatakan bahwa Julie adalah makhluk ciptaan Clea, padahal bukan. Untuk itu setelah membunuh Julie, Painted Verso menguburkan tubuhnya di bawah pohon rindang di area Forgotten Battlefield. Kalau saja Painted Verso memiliki kekuatan untuk menghidupkan kembali seseorang, ia akan memilih untuk menghidupkan Julie. Painted Verso dan Painted Renoir kemudian memutuskan untuk kembali ke Lumière dan memperingatkan para warga disana bahwa Paintress alias Aline yang terjebak di Monolith bukanlah ancaman yang sesungguhnya, tapi kepulangan mereka justru mengundang kecurigaan dari para warga Lumière, terutama karena dari sekian banyaknya anggota Expedition Zerro yang berangkat, hanya mereka berdua yang masih bertahan hidup, dan itupun mereka memiliki hubungan keluarga. Atas ini, Painted Renoir membawa Painted Verso dan Painted Alicia ke luar dari Lumière. Dan sejak itu, Painted Renoir bertekad untuk menjaga kebahagiaan Paintress alias Aline dan mengabdikan diri untuk melindungi keluarganya dan dunia kanvas. Selama 15 tahun lamanya, tidak ada satupun warga Lumière yang berani menginjakkan kaki ke luar Lumière, namun mereka dengan cepat menyadari bahwa angka yang tertulis di Monolith adalah semacam kutukan yang akan membunuh manusia dengan usia sama atau lebih tua dari angka tersebut. Mereka akan mengalami Gommage, meninggalkan orang-orang tercintanya. Nah tapi mereka salah mengira bahwa sumber kutukan itu berasal dari Paintress, karena yang mereka lihat adalah Paintress akan terbangun setiap tahunnya untuk mengubah angka di Monolith. Mereka tidak tahu bahwa itu adalah peringatan yang justru diberikan oleh Paintress agar mereka bisa bersiap-siap dari peristiwa Gommage yang dijalankan oleh Renoir asli di bawah Monolith. Sejak itulah, warga Lumière memulai kembali program ekspedisi dari Tahun Monolith ke-84. Kelompok Ekspedisi 60 yang dikenal sebagai kelompok Ekspedisi Legendaris karena taktiknya yang tidak lazim, dimana mereka percaya tubuh manusia adalah yang terkuat dari segalanya, berhasil menembus lapisan Monolith dan mendapati kebenaran yang mengejutkan, bahwa tidak seperti yang mereka pikirkan, Paintress bukan merupakan penyebab utama Gommage terjadi, melainkan ancaman sesungguhnya ada di bawah Monolith, tidak lain adalah Renoir. Untuk itu sementara yang lainnya menghadapi Renoir di bawah Monolith, William, sang penulis jurnal, ditugaskan untuk kembali ke Lumière dan memperingatkan semua orang akan kebenaran ini. Tapi sayang di tengah ia berupaya berenang melintasi lautan, waktu hidupnya habis, ia mengalami Gommage dan meninggalkan jurnal terakhirnya di lautan lepas. Jurnal ini tidak pernah sampai ke ekspedisi berikutnya, sehingga mereka tetap melakukan ekspedisi demi menumbangkan Paintress. Tapi dari Tahun Monolith ke 84 sampai Tahun Monolith ke 34, tidak ada satupun anggota eksepdisi yang pulang dengan selamat, dan hal ini bisa terjadi karena mereka kerap kali disergap oleh Painted Renoir di tengah perjalanan. Painted Renoir memiliki kekuatan yang tidak main-main, memungkinkannya untuk menghabisi mereka semua dengan cepat dan mudah. Jadi sebenarnya sosok Renoir yang muncul di sepanjang game Clair Obscur adalah Painted Renoir, versi lukisan dari Renoir, bukan Renoir yang asli. Berlawanan dengan Renoir asli yang ingin mengeluarkan Aline dari dunia lukisan dan menghancurkan kanvas, Painted Renoir justru bertekad untuk melindungi Aline bagaimanapun caranya, sehingga ketika ia melihat ada kelompok ekspedisi yang menempuh perjalanan untuk membunuh Paintress, ia akan datang dan membunuh mereka semua. Nah sementara Painted Renoir sibuk mengurusi para ekspedisi, painted Verso menempuh jalannya sendiri dan memulai petulangan di benua selama bertahun-tahun kedepan, dimana di sepanjang perjalanannya ini, ia bertemu dengan beberapa kelompok ekspedisi dan berteman dengan makhluk-makhluk lain seperti Monoco dan Esquie. Baik Monoco dan Esquie sudah mengerti kebenaran tentang dunia lukisan dan identitas Painted Verso yang sebenarnya, karena mereka berdua adalah makhluk ciptaan Verso asli sejak kecil. Hubungan mereka dengan Painted Verso mencerminkan hubungan mereka dengan Verso yang asli, mereka sangat bersahabat. Pada satu titik, Painted Verso mulai merasa muak dengan keabadian yang ada dalam dirinya, dan saat Painted Renoir mengetahui soal ini, hubungan keduanya pun memburuk, terutama karena Painted Verso mengambil jalur yang berlawanan dengan Painted Renoir dengan mendedikasikan dirinya untuk menghancurkan Paintress, berharap ayah aslinya, Renoir, berhasil mengeluarkan Aline dari dunia lukisan. Inilah yang menjelaskan kenapa setiap kali bertemu dengan Painted Renoir, Painted Verso selalu menentang keinginannya, sedangkan Painted Renoir selalu berusaha meyakinkan Painted Verso untuk kembali memihak Paintress. Painted Alicia sendiri berdiri di tengah-tengah mereka, tidak tahu sisi mana yang harus ia dukung. Di Tahun Monolith ke-58, Painted Verso sempat menemani kelompok eksepdisi 58 ke Old Lumière untuk menakhlukkan Axon, namun Painted Renoir menghentikan mereka. Sementara itu di luar dunia lukisan alias di realita, lebih tepatnya pada Tahun Monolith ke-49, Alicia yang baru saja terbangun dari mimpi buruknya mengenai insiden kebakaran manor dipanggil oleh Clea ke ruang melukis. Clea merasa keterlibatannya dalam menciptakan Nevron di dunia lukisan kurang efektif, sehingga ia membujuk Alicia untuk memasuki kanvas milik Verso dan membantu Renoir mengeluarkan Aline dari sana. Ia sendiri harus mengurusi peperangan yang terjadi antara faksi pelukis dan penulis. Alicia yang merasa bertanggung jawab atas seluruh konflik keluarga Dessendre dan juga atas keinginannya untuk menjalani kehidupan normal seperti orang pada umumnya, memutuskan untuk menerima permintaan Clea. Sebelum itu, Alicia dan Clea menyembunyikan kanvas milik Verso di tempat tersembunyi agar nantinya kalau Aline berhasil dikeluarkan dari dunia lukisan, ia tidak bisa menemukan kanvas tersebut. Namun dalam proses transisi perpindahan dari dunia realita ke dunia lukisan, Alicia kewalahan dengan efek chroma milik Aline yang terlalu kuat sampai-sampai ia tidak sengaja terlahir kembali sebagai Maelle tanpa ingatan mengenai dirinya sendiri. Sesuai dengan yang sudah diceritakan di Act 1 dan 2, Maelle kehilangan kedua orang tuanya saat ia masih menginjak usia 3 tahun dan pada akhirnya dibesarkan oleh Gustave yang sudah ia anggap sebagai sosok kakak dan ayahnya. Maelle memutuskan untuk bergabung ke dalam kelompok ekspedisi 33 dan sering mendapatkan pengelihatan aneh dihampiri oleh Painted Renoir dan Painted Alicia, dimana Painted Alicia merasa iri melihat wajah Maelle yang tidak meninggalkan bekas luka bakar. Di saat yang bersamaan, Painted Verso lagi-lagi dihampiri oleh Clea yang kali ini memberitahu bahwa Alicia sudah memasuki dunia lukisan dan terlahir kembali sebagai Maelle tanpa ingatan apa-apa, dan untuk itu, ia meminta Painted Verso untuk mengawasi Maelle. Painted Verso menyetujui hal ini dan ia diam-diam mengawasi Maelle. Saat Ekspedisi 33 disergap oleh Painted Renoir di pesisir pantai, Painted Verso menyelamatkan Maelle dan menempatkannya di manor keluarga Dessendre di bawah pengawasan The Curator. Kemungkinan dia jugalah yang menyelamatkan Gustave dan meletakkannya di Spring Meadows. Painted Verso kemudian meninggalkan pesan untuk Gustave dan Lune di Indigo Tree mengenai keberadaan Maelle, memungkinkan mereka untuk berkumpul kembali dengannya. Orang yang mengawasi Gustave dan Lune dari kejauhan saat mereka memasuki manor keluarga Dessendre di Weird Corals adalah Painted Verso. Lalu siapa itu The Curator? Terungkap melalui perkataan Painted Renoir, The Curator adalah Renoir yang asli. Saat terjebak di bawah Monolith, selain memulai peristiwa Gommage, Renoir juga memproyeksikan sebagian dirinya ke luar Monolith dalam wujud The Curator. Inilah kenapa The Curator sangat peduli dengan Maelle, anaknya sendiri. Bahkan Maelle juga sempat sekilas mendapatkan pengelihatan mengenai Renoir tepat di saat ia memberikan topeng Mask Keeper pada The Curator... Di sepanjang perjalanannya bersama Ekspedisi 33, Maelle beberapa kali mengaku merasa familiar, seperti saat ia melihat manor keluarga Dessendre dan saat melihat tarian Sirène. Hal ini tentu bisa terjadi karena itu adalah manor kediamannya dan Sirène dibuat oleh Renoir berdasarkan Aline, ibu Maelle. Painted Verso sendiri sempat berbisik setelah menakhlukkan Axon Mask Keeper, menebak-nebak apakah Mask Keeper diciptakan oleh Renoir berdasarkan Verso atau Renoir. Seperti yang sudah dijelaskan sebelumnya, Renoir menciptakan Mask Keeper berdasarkan Verso. Pada akhirnya dengan bantuan Painted Verso yang sangat pintar menyembunyikan motif aslinya, ekspedisi 33 berhasil menembus lapisan pelindung Monolith, dimana disana Painted Verso sempat menatap ke arah Paintress dengan tatapan yang sedih. Kini semuanya menjadi jelas, Painted Verso sedih karena ia harus berhadapan dengan ibunya sendiri. Berhasil menakhlukkan Painted Renoir dengan bantuan The Curator, dan kemudian menumbangkan Paintress alias Aline, Maelle sempat bereaksi ketika dipanggil sebagai Alicia oleh Paintress. Kemungkinan di saat itulah ingatan Alicia kembali secara perlahan. Eksepdisi 33 pulang ke Lumière dan disambut dengan meriah, namun kematian Paintress justru menandai kemenangan Renoir, sehingga Gommage pun terjadi, memusnahkan seluruh warga Lumière kecuali Painted Verso, Esquie, dan Monoco. Setelah mengalami Gommage, Maelle ditendang keluar dari dunia lukisan dan mendapatkan kembali seluruh ingatannya, baik sebagai Alicia maupun Maelle. Sama juga dengan Aline yang setelah berhasil ditakhlukkan, ditendang keluar dari kanvas, namun karena sebelumnya Alicia dan Clea sudah menyembunyikan kanvas milik Verso, ia tidak bisa menemukannya dimana-mana. Sadar Renoir masih belum keluar dari dunia lukisan, Alicia memutuskan untuk masuk sekali lagi, dimana di dalam sana, ia menemui Painted Verso yang tampak sudah muak dengan segala kepalsuan di dunia ini. Alicia mengatakan ia lebih senang disebut sebagai Maelle dan berusaha menghiburnya. Ia juga mengungkapkan keinginannya untuk tetap mempertahankan kanvas milik Verso, sehingga bersama dengan Painted Verso, ia pergi menemui The Curator yang menunjukkan wujud aslinya sebagai Renoir asli. Mereka segera melepas rindu, namun menjadi jelas bahwa mereka tidak memiliki tujuan yang sama ketika Renoir mengungkapkan rencana berikutnya, yaitu menghancurkan kanvas milik Verso, mengklaim jika mereka tidak menghancurkannya, Aline pasti suatu saat nanti akan kembali lagi ke dalam dunia lukisan ini. Renoir mengingatkan bahwa mereka harus bisa sesegera mungkin menerima kematian Verso dan melanjutkan kehidupan seperti biasa. Mendengar ini, Maelle berusaha meyakinkan Renoir untuk tidak menghancurkan kanvas Verso, mengklaim ia sudah menyembunyikan kanvas di tempat tersembunyi yang tidak mungkin diketahui oleh Aline dan sangat menyayangkan bila satu-satunya kanvas Verso yang masih menyimpan jiwa Verso di dalamnya dihancurkan begitu saja. Bahkan disini Maelle menekankan bahwa dunia lukisan milik Verso sudah seperti rumah baginya, yang dimana perkataan ini seketika membuat Renoir tersadar bahwa Maelle tidak ada bedanya dengan Aline. Maelle mengingatkan sang ayah mengenai kondisinya di realita, wajahnya penuh bekas luka bakar dan ia tidak bisa berbicara. Sementara disini, ia bisa mendapatkan kehidupan yang normal. Tetap saja, Renoir tidak bisa menerima alasan ini, sehingga atas kemarahannya melihat Maelle yang sangat keras kepala, ia pun menggunakan kekuatannya untuk memanggil Nevron demi mengusir Maelle dari dunia luikisan. Painted Verso mengalami Gommage, namun sebelum benar-benar menghilang, Maelle menggunakan kekuatannya untuk menghentikan proses Gommage. Di saat yang tepat, Esquie kembali menampakkan diri dan membawa mereka pergi dari sana. Maelle menghabiskan waktunya sepanjang malam untuk mempelajari kekuatan melukis, dan atas bantuan Painted Verso, ia pun berhasil menguasainya dan membangkitkan kembali teman-temannya yang mengalami Gommage, yaitu Lune dan Sciel. Gustave tidak bisa ia bangkitkan kembali karena Gustave tidak mengalami Gommage, melainkan mati terbunuh Painted Renoir. Maelle memberitahukan seluruh kebenaran yang terjadi pada Lune dan Sciel, membuat Lune marah terhadap Painted Verso yang selama ini berbohong pada mereka. Tapi bagaimanapun juga, mereka kini harus menyatukan kekuatan untuk menghadapi Renoir demi mempertahankan kanvas milik Verso, dan mereka berlima tidak mungkin bisa menghadapi Renoir yang kini sudah menguasai dunia lukisan. Mereka harus mencari cara lain untuk mendapatkan lebih banyak bantuan. Kalau saja mereka memiliki lebih banyak chroma, Maelle bisa menghidupkan seluruh anggota ekspedisi yang sudah mati. Di saat Maelle bergumam tentang hal itu, Lune teringat dengan mayat anggota ekspedisi yang mereka temukan di sepanjang perjalanan. Kebanyakan dari mereka mati terbunuh oleh Nevron, dan orang yang mati terbunuh Nevron tidak mengalami Gommage karena chroma yang ada dalam tubuh mereka dirusak. Ini artinya di dalam tubuh setiap anggota eksepdisi yang mati, masih ada chroma yang bisa Maelle manfaatkan untuk menghidupkan mereka meski tidak bisa benar-benar hidup. Untuk itu, kelimanya mulai melakukan penjelajahan ke berbagai wilayah dan membangkitkan satu persatu anggota ekspedisi yang gugur, menjadikan mereka sebagai pasukan bantuan. Setelah dirasa sudah memiliki kekuatan yang cukup, mereka pergi menuju Lumière dan mengerahkan seluruh pasukan untuk menghadapi para Nevron yang menguasai jalanan kota. Melalui pertempuran demi pertempuran, ekspedisi 33 berhasil menakhlukkan Creation yang adalah makhluk terkuat ciptaan Renoir dan pada akhirnya berhadapan dengan Renoir. Dalam pertemuan ini, Renoir mengaku ia juga sebenarnya tidak ingin menghancurkan jiwa terakhir Verso yang masih terikat dengan kanvas, tapi ia kemudian mengingatkan bahwa itu adalah cara terbaik untuk berduka. Sadar Maelle masih keras kepala ingin mempertahankan kanvas milik Verso, Renoir tidak memiliki pilihan lain selain menghentikan upayanya, memulai pertarungan terakhir... Renoir mengubah wujudnya menjadi The Curator, dan dalam pertarungan ini, ia memanfaatkan bantuan Axon yang akan selalu memberikannya penyembuhan terlepas dari sekuat apapun serangan Ekspedisi 33. Eksepdisi 33 mulai kelelahan di tengah pertarungan dengan Lune mengusul agar mereka fokus menyerang Axonnya terlebih dahulu, namun di saat semuanya tampak sudah hilang harapan, sebuah portal terbuka dan Aline kembali menampakkan diri. Renoir mengkhawatirkan kondisi Aline yang terlalu cepat masuk kembali ke dalam kanvas, namun Aline tidak mempedulikannya dan menggunakan kekuatan Paintress untuk menyerang Axon, memberikan ekspedisi 33 kesempatan untuk menyerang Renoir yang kini sudah tidak bisa mendapatkan penyembuhan. Renoir marah dan melepaskan kekuatan yang jauh lebih berbahaya, namun Ekspedisi 33 berhasil mengungguli pertarungan dan menakhlukkannya... Dalam keadaan terluka parah, Renoir bercerita tentang bagaimana dulu ia memiliki kehidupan yang sangat bahagia dengan Aline. Aline mengajarinya cara melukis tanpa membahayakan nyawa dan mereka berdua menciptakan ratusan dunia kanvas dengan menuangkan kreativitas mereka. Ironisnya, Aline justru adalah orang yang dulu mengingatkannya untuk jangan terlalu lama menghabiskan waktu di dalam dunia lukisan, mengklaim selalu ada harga yang harus dibayar untuk setiap detik yang mereka habiskan di dunia ini. Tepat pada saat itu, Aline mengalami Gommage, keluar ke realita, mungkin karena tubuhnya yang masih belum terlalu kuat berlama-lama di dalam dunia kanvas. Renoir untuk terakhir kalinya mengingatkan Maelle bahwa ini semua bukan sebuah permainan, namun Maelle masih tetap keras kepala, mengklaim ia tahu Renoir merasa bersalah atas kematian Verso dan ingin melindungi setiap anggota keluarganya setelah itu, tapi menurutnya, menghancurkan kanvas milik Verso tidak akan membantu mereka merelakan kematian Verso. Renoir tidak tahu harus melakukan apa lagi untuk meyakinkan Maelle menghancurkan kanvas, sehingga ia menunjukkan apa yang terjadi pada Aline setelah puluhan tahun menjebak dirinya di dalam dunia kanvas. Kondisi kesehatan Aline merosot seiring berjalannya waktu dan itulah yang Renoir lihat setiap harinya. Ia tidak ingin hal yang sama terjadi pada Maelle, ia tidak ingin kehilangan Alicia. Painted Verso terkejut melihat kondisi ibunya. Namun di sisi lain, Maelle mengatakan bahwa perasaan yang sama juga ia rasakan. JIka kanvas dihancurkan, ia akan kehilangan seluruh temannya di Lumière, Lune, Sciel, Esquie, Monoco, dan semua orang lain yang tinggal di dunia kanvas. Maelle mengaku ia sudah kehilangan terlalu banyak, begitu pula dengan Renoir. Maelle kemudian berjanji akan selalu menyempatkan diri untuk keluar dari kanvas, ia juga tidak ingin kehilangan ayahnya. Mendengar ini, Renoir yang awalnya ragu pada akhirnya hanya bisa pasrah... Renoir mengalami Gommage dan keluar dari kanvas, membiarkan Maelle melakukan apa yang ia inginkan. Painted Verso di sisi lain, tidak tega melihat kondisi ibunya yang kian memburuk, memutuskan untuk memasuki jantung kanvas tempat ia bertemu dengan jiwa Verso kecil yang sedang sibuk melukis. Ia sadar jiwa Verso sudah kelelahan setelah bertahun-tahun dipaksa untuk selalu melukis tanpa henti, dan untuk itu, ia memintanya untuk berhenti melukis. Di saat yang bersamaan, tubuh Painted Verso mulai menghilang secara perlahan, dan Maelle menyadari bahwa Painted Verso tidak seharusnya berada di jantung kanvas. Saat Maelle menyentuhnya, proses Gommage berhenti, namun Maelle segera menyadari bahwa Painted Verso memiliki pandangan yang berbeda dengannya ketika Painted Verso mengutip kata-kata Renoir, “Lihatlah sesuatu sebagaimana adanya, bukan sebagaimana kita menginginkannya.” Painted Verso tahu Maelle berbohong pada Renoir tentang bagaimana ia akan tetap menyempatkan diri untuk sesekali keluar dari dunia kanvas. Sebaliknya, Maelle ingin menghabiskan seluruh hidupnya di dunia kanvas karena disini ia bisa hidup seperti orang normal. Maelle tidak bisa mengelak, mengatakan jika ia keluar dari kanvas, Renoir pasti langsung menghancurkan kanvas milik Verso. Sadar ia tidak bisa mengubah pemikiran Maelle, Painted Verso berusaha mengajak jiwa kecil Verso untuk berhenti melukis. Namun Maelle segera menghentikannya, tidak memberikan Painted Verso pilihan lain selain menghadapi adiknya sendiri... Di titik ini, kita dihadapkan pada 2 pilihan, berpihak pada Maelle atau Painted Verso, yang dimana pilihan ini akan menentukan ending dari game Clair Obscur Expedition 33. Jika kita memilih untuk berpihak pada Painted Verso, maka Painted Verso terpaksa mengalahkan Maelle dalam duel, memaksanya untuk pergi meninggalkan dunia kanvas... Setelah mengucapkan selamat tinggal pada Maelle, Painted Verso memeluk erat kedua sahabatnya, Esquie dan Monoco sebelum mereka berdua mengalami Gommage. Sciel bisa menerima keputusan Painted Verso, berbeda dengan Lune yang kecewa karena merasa dikhianati. Painted Verso kemudian mengajak jiwa kecil Verso untuk pergi... mengajak jiwa kecil Verso untuk pergi... Di bagian epilogue, kita dipertunjukkan pada keluarga Dessendre yang berkumpul di halaman depan manor tempat Verso dikuburkan. Tertulis di makamnya bahwa Verso meninggal pada tanggal 33 Desember tahun 1905. Alicia membawa boneka Esquie dan untuk terakhir kalinya melihat teman-temannya di Lumière... Jika kita memilih untuk berpihak pada Maelle, maka Maelle terpaksa mengalahkan Painted Verso dalam duel. Sebelum mengalami Gommage, Painted Verso memohon pada Maelle untuk menyuruh jiwa kecil Verso berhenti melukis dan menghentikan semua ini... Di bagian epilogue, kita dipertunjukkan pada warga Lumière yang berkumpul di gedung opera untuk menyaksikan penampilan Verso. Maelle datang membawa anak didik Gustave dan berkumpul dengan yang lainnya, Lune, Sciel, dan Pierro. Tak lama kemudian, Gustave datang bersama Sophie. Gustave yang ada di ending ini sepertinya bukan Gustave yang sama, mengingat ia mati terbunuh oleh Painted Renoir dan tidak bisa dihidupkan kembali, sehingga Maelle hanya menciptakan seseorang yang menyerupai wujud Gustave. Game diakhiri dengan pertunjukan piano Verso... Adegan terakhir yang menunjukkan wajah Maelle dengan bekas cat di matanya kemungkinan menunjukkan bahwa Maelle akan bernasib sama seperti Aline. Kesehatannya terus merosot seiring ia menghabiskan waktu di dunia kanvas... Nah sebenarnya ending A Life to Paint sudah di spoiler di salah satu interaksi Maelle dengan Painted Verso, dimana pada saat itu, Painted Verso berbicara tentang kegemarannya dalam bermain musik, terutama piano. Dan Maelle mengatakan bahwa setelah semuanya berakhir, ia akan memperbaiki gedung opera dan memastikan Painted Verso tampil disana. Itu adalah akhir dari game Clair Obscur Expedition 33, tapi masih ada beberapa side quest yang bisa kita kerjakan, dan salah satu side quest yang cukup penting adalah side quest Maelle. Untuk mendapatkan side quest Maelle, Painted Verso harus menjalin hubungan yang baik dengan Maelle sampai Lv. 6. Dengan begitu, Maelle akan menemukan surat pemberian Painted Alicia dan mengungkapkan keinginannya untuk bertemu dengannya. Painted Verso mengabulkan keinginannya dengan mempertemukannya pada Painted Alicia di The Reacher yang sedang sibuk melukis, dimana disana, begitu menyadari keberadaan Maelle, Painted Alicia langsung memindahkan mereka berdua ke alam lain dan mempertemukannya pada Axon The Reacher. Atas keinginan Painted Alicia, keduanya kemudian berduel, dan setelah Maelle mengalahkannya, mereka kembali ke dunia normal, tempat Maelle menggunakan kekuatannya untuk menghapus keberadaan Painted Alicia dari kanvas. Painted Alicia berbicara untuk pertama kalinya disini, meminta Maelle mengirim dirinya ke keluarganya. Painted Verso terkejut melihat kematian Painted Alicia, tapi ia tahu ia harus merelakan kepergiannya. Ini adalah side quest yang menunjukkan akhir dari nasib Painted Alicia.

Before we dive into today's another grueling work week at Water Park Town, toilet town. Um, I'd like to uh thank everybody for coming to the finance meeting. We just have to go over a couple things to ensure uh the success of Toilet Town in the future. I would ask for everybody to settle down, but I know that's asking too much. So, as long as I have your attention, um I guess feel free to uh speak amongst yourselves. Um, for starters, hello. My name is Samaba. You can call me Saba or Fish Freak. Um, I am the uh uh general manager of uh Toilet Town. I got three name tags. I do. I do. You're right. Um I It's a lot of work working Toilet Town.

Uh on-site janitor, maintenance, general manager. I'm in charge of finances. Um and and strategy. Um demoted from CEO. Excuse me, sir. Sir, you don't have to hold that sign up. That's that's very rude. your big What is this? You think this is a WWE match? You could put the sign down. Demoted from CEO. I can see you. Anyway, um today I want to take a quick moment to talk about Toilet Town before we before we head back to work for another glorious week at Toilet Town or two weeks perhaps. I'm so sorry. Hold it. Is this a corporate takeover? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm simply here to help. I'm simply here to help. Um, all right. Thank you. Okay. I'm I will go ahead and get started. I don't want to take up too much of your time. This will be this will be nice and easy and fast and painless. Relatively painless. Um, okay. Toilet town. Everybody loves Toilet Town. You know, big water park. Toilet is a water park. Toilet Town is a is a new upand cominging water park, a destination in which you can have lots of fun with water and slides. That's our that's our main our main offering export is fun with slides. Yes, fun with slides. All right. Okay. Great. Uh progress. Uh, Toilet Town has been operational for just 14 days or two weeks and within that time it has managed to become a twostar water park which is very impressive given the the town that we have decided to establish ourselves in. We have record sales of nearly 300 tickets sold in one single day. That's pretty great for a for a two week old park, right? Um, we have on average over 50% guest satisfaction rating and we plan on making sure that number stays uh 50% or you know ultimately our goal is to make sure that that number hits ideally at least 75% by the end of this quarter. Um, accomplishments uh, no one has died on property. We are very proud of this, aren't we? Uh, here at Toilet Town 50% survival rate. No, no, no. That's satisfaction rating. Satisfaction. We have a 50% satisfaction rating. Um, no one has no one has uh deceased deceased died. No one has perished. Nice. Yes, we have no deaths recorded uh on property at uh toilet town. See that? See, it was a gift, but I took a screenshot. This was a gift. This was a gift. And this was also a gift. Ah, but unfortunately due to the limits of technology, I've taken a screenshot. So therefore, they are both static images. Uh [Music] anyway, um some more accomplishments for Toilet Town is the people love gizzies. They love hot dogs. They really love hot dogs and lemonade. Those are our that that's I think that's a main draw for some reason uh to Toilet Town is our is our food offerings of gizzies and lemonade. Uh usard uh also our unique theming is striking success and intrigue among theme park enthusiasts and locals alike. I mean who goes to a water park? Oh water park. When you hear water park, what do you think of? Maybe unhygienic fun for the whole family. Here at Toilet Town, we lean into such uh such taboo, I guess you could say, of toilets and hygiene as our as our overall theme. You know, they they say that there is no such thing as bad press. Only interest and interest drive interest drives sales. Am I right? Sorry, I'm a bit nervous. Um, the color of a used toilet. No, nah. Nuh-uh. You shut up. How do I flip this pointer? Flip it at you. Wait. What? Any any questions so far? Any questions so far? I don't think there's any questions. Um, fresh, never frozen. Oh, that's right. Oh, that's a good point. Our our hot dog and lemonade offerings are always fresh. We take you by the local uh Kmart um that is across the street that hopefully one day we can uh reach a collaborative a mutual collaboration, a business collaboration so they can lower their prices and stop gouging me for some hot dogs, man. Uh admission. Ah, good question. How much is admission? Well, I can't get you an exact number, but I can say that we are steadily increasing the general admission price. Um, as the park continues to grow in size and more attractions are added, the general ticket sale price will uh it will increase, but the people keep buying. So, I say we we keep charging them more. I mean, it doesn't seem to be a problem so far. If the people are buying, uh, see how far you can go with it, I guess. And growing at a very slow pace. Yes. Yes. But we plan to increase overall overall speed of sales. The end of this quarter is coming up and and it is looking very promising for Toilet Down. any discounts, senior discounts? Um, no. Speaking of the success reaching the end of the quarter, Toilet Town is a great success with just big all across the board. As you can see here by the statistics and and the graphs here it up bumpy up big number and and according to the pie chart sales are up attendance is up. Sales is up. Interest is up to the moon. Toilet town to the moon. Exactly. Exactly. But alas, we must uh we must speak about the risks of Toilet Town, the areas of which we must pay attention to. Um like my little caution sign here. This wasn't a gift. This was just a still image. Um, we have a consistent slip hazard growing. Um, well, sticking, growing and sticking. Um, as uh the park janitors have failed to keep up with the demand of of mopping up. Um, which is why I am wearing this janitor badge today. As as you can see here, as I have, it'll make sense in the next slide, but I have fully taken over the janitorial role once again. um as the janitors that we employed didn't couldn't meet the uh expectations that we had for Toilet Town's hygiene. That's a gift. This was you know this one. It was it was a gift. It is no longer a gift. Um where else here? Low tips. Ah yes, park our guests complain about limited activities and this is reflecting in in in our the reviews of Toilet Town and the lack of tips. Tips is a very important part of Toilet Town's uh source of revenue and the we need to increase um the amount of attractions in the park solution. Increase uh attractions increase uh ticket sales and then hopefully that'll balance it out. Yes, we need bigger we need more more tips and uh and big big tips. Uh solution for the janitorial problem is that we are going to reassign them to um a position that we believe that the janitors could handle better, which will make sense in our next slide. order gallons of wood. Introducing project vend is friend. Currently, Toilet Town runs on a persontoperson communication process. Our tickets are handled by a human. Um, our janitors are human. Our maintenance men are human, our everything is run by human and that leads to human error. Uh so the goal is to uh introduce a more consumer friendly, a more streamlined approach uh with our ticketing system, but also with our food. Are you human? Yes. Of course I am. Um Hm. We are going to be removing our hot dog and lemonade stand and replacing it with many, many vending machines. They're going to be relocating our janitors to a uh restocking position. They're going to be uh restocking the systems. It's simpler. There's there's less there's less room for confusion or or or error, I think. No user. No USD. No more uh soulless. No, no, no, no, no, no. This is streamlined. It's streamlined. Not soulless. Streamlined. Um, this will also increase our revenue flow, you'll see, because we'll be placing vending machines at the park entrance to encourage our consumers to consume. You enter a water park and the first thing you see is a food option with no human interaction. You just bang your credit card and you're good. Boom, sales. And then on the way out, they got to walk past the vending machines. Boom, sales. It's I mean, it's it's foolproof. You'll see. We're going to uh this will be put into action as soon as possible. We'll be launching project vending for it, which should happen in approximately the next uh hour and a half or so. Vending machine took my job. No, no, no, no, no. See, you could we could you you will be hired as a as a stock as stock. Restock. Inventory. Inventory. Inventory. We love inventory. It's an exciting position. It's a It's an exciting opportunity. Restock the box. Exactly. Um, if need be, we can make like a little morale boosting rhyme for the Venice friend. Restock the box. Restock the box. I love Toilet Town. You know, you know, something like that. Something catchy. We could hire like a Tik Tok song artist to really to really uh push it forward um and and encourage other Tik Tockers to uh utilize the Vendis friend slogan song. Bend his friend. It's so cool. I can't wait to watch the water slide with you. Ah. Any questions? Vend is friend, not food. Exactly. But vend will lead to food and that will lead to sales. What about the usard? If we can expand far enough um in order to maybe host like a small dining area, then then I could potentially see us bringing back the hot dogs and the usard. But for now, I think this is the right move. I think Venda Venda's friend is the right move. Why are the uniforms brown? Because everybody loves the color brown. It's such a comforting color. Plus, Toilet Town, that's our toilet down color. Everything is brown. All right. I'm not seeing any push back here, so I'm going to go ahead and move on and uh assume that everything is satisfactory for Vendas's friend. It's very nice to know that you guys are so supportive of uh uh in this hip technological world a consumerfriendly option here. Look, look. You can't deny it. Look big. Oh, it's big. Voodoo town. Watch your language. All right. So, before we wrap up, I just want to give a quick little schedule layout for uh what we're going to be getting done in the next quarter. Uh the entire park needs a bit of a a faceelift. You know, we're working we're working from ground zero here. So, we need to um give it a nice fresh paint job in a rich chocolatey brown today. Uh hopefully we can invite some local artists, some people call it graffiti, uh to paint the Toilet Town slogan around the property. I'm thinking poop everywhere, but we'll have to see, you know, you know, have the young people come in and really give it a nice young touch. That'll happen today hopefully. We'll be we'll be launching project vent friend for more money. Um this might come before this. I'm not really sure. Um today we will be uh erecting toilet town slide. The toilet sorry the toilet tower slide. Potentially two toilet tower or three or more. We're not really sure. You're suing me. What? What? How did you get into this meeting? Put your hand down. I'm not interested. Um, and ultimately we would like to become a fivestar water park and we're going to make the Trip Advisor uh top top places to be, top theme parks um across social media uh travel sites, Trip Advisor. What's the other one? Uh Yelp. Can I take a vacation? No. Put your hand down. I'm not interested. No. So, that's our schedule for the the next quarter. But it looks like I was a bit eager when I wrote this as everything is written to be done today. Well, then I I guess we better get busy. And remember, everybody loves Toilet Town. And you know what that means? Toilet Town loves you. I really should have found like a clapping audio. I forgot to do that. Everybody's just going to quietly like leave. Okay. Well, thank you everybody for coming to the Toilet Town financial meeting. I hope I answered some questions you had about the future of Toilet Town. And um wash your hands after visiting. Yes. Practicing hygiene is smart for everybody. Yes. That's right. That's what I like to see. We love Toilet Town. I love Toilet Town. Yeah. All right. Thank you for coming. Thank you for coming. Um if you give me two seconds, I will change into appropriate attire and we will get started. Okay. I'll be right back. Let's give you some music, guys. Can you hear this? How is the audio?

I can't get the I can't I don't know how to get the glasses off my face. Help. Stuck. Ah. What the heck? I can't get them off. I can't get them off. They're stuck. Keep them on. But I don't I don't then I I look too official. Official. I see what I did there. Give me a sec. Ah, give me a sec. [Music] Oh god, I look naked without them now. Oh my. Oh my goodness. One moment, please. All right. This is the game BGM, by the way. We're going to use the game music cuz I think it changes. I thought it was the same song throughout the entire thing, but I was I was wrong. I was incorrect. All right. Who's ready? Who's ready to play a little bit of video games? I mean, no toilet. This is a lifestyle. [Music] Don't I look naked without them now? Ew. a little bit. I probably just look normal to you. Hi, by the way. Hi. Um, what's up? Hey, I started watching Dexter.

That's embarrassing. Okay. Is this better? Toilet town. Oh, how I missed you. So that's really loud. Why is that so loud? What's going on? Wait a sec. I did something. Sorry, they had a game update. I think they Why does it look like doodoo? Does it look like doodoo to you? I don't let those seagulls go overhead. That's just quite annoying. Wait, did it look like this last time? Why does this look so bad? Like there's no shadows. Is that what it is? There's no shadows anywhere. This looks like It looks the same, does it? No, this doesn't look the same. [Music] It does. It looks It doesn't look that great. Quality preset. Hi. Do I have to restart the game? Is it still too bright? Is it I I I did I just uploaded I just updated it before the stream and I figured I figured everything would be fine. Yeah, I don't think it's here. Let me um Will this work? Quality preset higher. I'm a little worried because When I did that, it like lagged the game out really bad. Had it set to low. What's going on here? Texture quality, high quality preset. Yeah, that is what it was. The qual the preset was set to low. Ah, there's the shadows. No, I'm not playing on a toaster. [Music] When did the seagulls go away? Now it's Now it's beautiful. Is it? I kind of want to see what Hi looks like. It's not a potato. [Music] You want to see my biceps every time? Okay. [Music] Is this better? Are we lagging? Is it lagging? Is anything lagging? Toilet town is awesome. That's what I like to hear. All right, let's just play like this. This is fine. I'll fix it later. Hey, when did the seagulls go away? I want to turn my audio back up. Okay, where are uh unlock the floor tool? We have three. Sorry guys, I got to get back in the swing of things. The swing of things. Um, bigger tips. Why is it Hold on. [Music] Well, the FPS limiter doesn't work. Where are we? We have to ticket machine. Where's the vending? Where's the vending machine? Vending machine. Vending machine. Vending machine. I don't think it's a basic vending machine. Basic drink vending machine. Food vending machine. There we go. That's right. They have food and drink. Modern pools. We need money. All right, we're going to I'm just going to play the next day um and see how we go from there. Wow, that music is annoying. Do you know what I mean now? Is the music annoying to you? Is it too loud? Sorry. I feel like it's too loud. All right, Jet, enjoy this last day here with the with the uh with the stuff here. I think the music will change as the day goes on, but we we'll we'll see. Okay, we're going to change it on the fly. Full send. I think the Well, no, actually all of them are going to Oh, of course. Thank you guys. I like how they waited until the park opened. They just kind of sat and hovered. Thank you, seagulls. Thank you. But Jake's going to be homeless. No, Jake's going to be inventory. He's going to get a a nice new home in inventory. Hello, sir. Welcome. Welcome. What do you mean, poo? Oh, you slipped in. He Genji slipped in the poo poo. All right, the shingles are gone. Uhoh. Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. Okay, it's fine. Ah, I forgot how to save people. It's going to be a bit of a bumpy start. I got to get rid of that. I need one of these. So, what I'm thinking is this section over here is going to be the dedicated pool section, and then the the entirety of the main the main property square is going to be vending machines. They're going to have to walk through a line of vending machines because it's going to force the NPC interaction to buy from the vending machine. It's going to work. It's just going to work. the dedicated warm section. I think we need a lifeguard. What should you just take a picture of? Somebody laugh too hard. Did you just call our customers NPCs? Oh, I'm sorry. The consumer. It's a compet a competitor spy. Do you remember what her name was? I remember what she was wearing. Should we go? Uh, make sure she doesn't leave the park with No pictures, ma'am. No photos. No pictures. Who took that photo? Oh, I forgot we had those. Oh. Oh. Oh, there's no time. See, this is why we're getting rid of these. There's too much time dedicated to serving, slinging us. Her name is Britney. Where is she? Get out of here. Get out of here. No photos. No photos. No photos that matter. Madam, I'm overwhelmed. I'm overwhelmed. I'm overwhelmed. Okay. I break all her fingers, so she can't upload the photos anywhere. But then she's still able to upload the photos and then my the reputation is just ruined. Sir, there's a trash can right here. We are having a a rough start to our week here. This is just this is a nightmare. All right. It's fine. It's fine. It's fine. It's fine. This is the new addition. This is the newest edition. This giant rubber slide. This giant blow up slide. I don't know if anybody likes it. I'm not I'm not sure. I don't remember. I don't remember. Sir, please. Oh, I forgot about the lemonade. This is a problem. This is such a problem. Lemon. My lemonade guy's neck is broken here. He's not. He better have a pirate breakdown. I'm call hot dog. Beep. Who just said e? All right. Everything everything looks to be everything is good. Everything is I saw I saw there was like a secret in game. I kind of want to look for it after this day is over. Oh dear. [Music] Endless music nightmare. All right, I think I think we're up and running now. Feel good. I feel good about this. I hate the layout of this park right now. All the pools are going to be moved over here. All the toilets are going to be moved over here. We're going to have a first line of Oh, okay. They have to come down here. If we block their path, I want them to have to file in. So, no matter which way, like if we do a line of hedges, if we do a line of vending machines and then a line of hedges, and then we just immediately dump them here, this will be the entrance to the park. And then immediately they're going to see the the pools right after they reach the That's really dirty. Then they get the pools and then in order to leave, they have to go back through this way. Kid's too tired. [Music] Crazy. They're like there's a trash can right behind them, but they still won't use it. I like how I've just handled dirty garbage and now I'm offering food. Oh, I bet that was this one. Welcome to pool maintenance the stream. What? What's that face for? What are they like ooing about? What is this? Ah, this one. [Music] Oh my god, it actually goes up. Look at all the hot Look at all the hot dog mustard on there. You should get a tip if you have Did you see the pile of that? Look. Watch. Watch. One squirt. Ew. The condiment dog. You want the bite? Here comes the plane. The user dog. Nothing but us. Oh my hot dog. That's a bummer. Out of the way. All right. I don't think we're going to have very good um feedback today on the the old progress report. It's fine, though. Finally, a streamer playing silk song. Also, apparently you can change the paint color of your hot dog stand. And oh jeez, hot dog stand. Oh, they're both drowning. Why don't they help each other out? Um um thank God. Usual drowning. Just give each other a helping hand. 70% satisfaction. That's actually insane. I was expecting to be down in the 20%. That ain't bad. Not bad at all. Way better. Employee of the month. Me maybe. See? Wait. I think Oh, I'm I'm thrown off. I'm thrown off. We have to We have to We have to um I got to re This is bothering me. I really have to rearrange this like right now. Otherwise, I'm It's going to bother me. Jake is not the CEO. I'm the CEO. Um, okay. We need this one. Yes. And that one because why not? Okay. So, we have food vending machines now. Why do we have like no money? There was somebody else I was watching and they consistently had multiple thousands. Am I just not Is this Am I doing something wrong? A Oh no, the floor tool. Oh no. Wait, where [Music] five? Dang it. Okay, don't let me do anything else. Hammer upgrade and then floor tool. you know, I went to the mustard. Um, okay. So, here's what I mean. The toilets are going to go here. Those are going to be all toilets. This is going to be all vending. We're going to shoot all of our customers down the line. Down the line. It might have to be like here. We're going to block them off with hedges so they can't get away from uh making locking eyes with all of our vending machine offerings. And they're going to shoot out here. This is going to be dedicated pool space. Uh maybe this as well. I think we can probably buy this. This looks like additional space. It is. It's red. It's highlighted red. Maybe we could have a a double entry exit way. Send them out this way. Send them out this way. But they have to come through here. That sounds like a fire hazard. Having only one in and out. Isn't that a Isn't that a fire hazard? Feels like a fire hazard. That's fourst star. Spoilers. Maximized efficiency. Exactly. [Music] Fire hazard at a water park. I mean, you don't know. You just don't know. Can you buy this here, too? No. This is the competitor. Um, well, shoot. I think I I got a little too excited buying the vending. Where is the vending?

Wait, this actually looks good. It's nice. It's like calming. It looks good. I should stop spending money. Clean graffiti from vandals. That sounds like it's going to be annoying to get done. Whole lot more waiting. Waiting and hoping and hoping and waiting. All right. I'm going to buy a couple more chairs. [Music] [Music] Just so we can really bring these people in. 23 24 25 26 And then the more people that we bring into the park, the more people are going to spend money on the vending machine. Yes, it's all coming together. Hit it. Excellent. Yes. Yes. Yes. Doesn't want to come to the park. I need Look at the line. I need to get rid of these. Oh, I meant to look.

Golden beach ball, blue hoodies. [Music] Hold on. Blue hoodie. It's like they know me now. How why am I how am I supposed to get rid of that? What if I did pe hoodies? I think you can erase it word by word. So, I'm trying to think. I don't know how much space the vandalizer skill. Maybe they can put it here, too. I want to keep some of it. It's It's funny [Music] graffiti. uninspired, uninspired, lame. No, no, no, no, no, no. Not the hot dog. The park is still half full. Well, how do I get the more people in? Oh no, dying. Hello.

Oh, so are my patrons. They have three research points now. That's pretty good. We are now seeing monetary returns. Boing. 2K monies. All the trash is stinking. Do you guys think the hot dog stands are worth it? Do better next time. Did I just read us and give you ketchup? My bad. I don't know if the hot dog stands are worth it. Caught the vandal likes to look dangerously dangerous to me. Well, that guy looked oily, I think. Is that it? Banana peel. I think we'll do fine. I think honestly. Wait, what is it? What? What? Basic toilet. Oh god, I've been neglecting the toilets. Uh yeah, banana peel. Oh, sorry. Now Donald is drowning. Oh my god, I can't keep up. She's getting a a I don't need staff. I need money. I need money to buy the vending machines. What happened? Here you go. Spoken like a true boss. Every time you hit something or clean something, every like individual hit or clean you do gives you one XP point. I just realized. Can I just wipe this up? Why don't you guys just walk around? Why are they walking on top of it? Just go around. Boo. I think I'm going to get rid of blue hoodies. 65% Blue hoodie. Blue. Bluehill. Blue. Blue. Goodbye. Yay. Automated tickets. Kiss your job. Goodbye, Jake. Automated tickets. Sh. Oh, now tickets cost more money. That's great. More paint colors. We need five. We might be able to get No, I don't think we'll be able to get that. We do need more bins. I'm going to make a move here. I'm going to sell our hot dog cart. I'm going to sell both of these. I should keep these until the lemonade runs out, but I'm going to sell the hot dog cart. Uh, yeah, the hot dog cart's going to go. I think it's time to bring in automation. No more gizzies. We'll see how we'll see how it does. Well, you see, when we get vending machines, it's going to put more people are going to feel more like like they're in control, you know? They'll love it. They'll love the feeling. It's going to be so good. This is a lot of work. And then and then Kmart across the street is going to notice a decline in their sales and they'll be like, "What's going on?" on. And then maybe they'll offer they'll offer to sell our hot dog recipe in their store, but give us all of the the revenue. We can put the hot dogs in the vending machines. See, now you're thinking. Now you're thinking, "Wow, these are nasty. I totally I neglected these." [Music] Uh, okay. We need uh more toilets. No, we need more trash cans. An automated hot dog dispenser. That's really smart. So close. All right. Kiss the hot dog stands goodbye. How do I sell this? I need the big hammer. Get a hot dog cannon. Oh, instead of a t-shirt cannon. That would be awesome. I hope you can sell like um I hope they do. Imagine being able to design a shirt and then sell it. Goodbye, hot dogs. Get out of here. Give me my money back. 150 bucks. No more usard. Okay. Time time to do a little bit of rearranging. There's a trash bin here. We could put one here. We have to finish painting our floor, too. But I think let's try Let's put our toilets here for now. it. I wish there was like inventory, you know, so you could put stuff in your inventory while you moved it around. Look how big moves here. Wait, that's going to annoy me. Oh, wait. That That lines up pretty good. That's pretty all right. [Music] Okay. Then we move our fountains back [Music] and whatever this thing is. A ladder on the side. What? Lifeguard maybe. It probably would save me a bit of time, wouldn't it? I'm going to destroy that. I think we can get a better one. A slide. We can get um [Music] yeah, a better diving board definitely. [Music] Showers will also be here. I'm going to buy the first vending machine. Vending. Vending. Vending. Yeah. Hey, how close can we put it? Oh my god, it's beautiful. We can put it here. [Music] Um, the entrance will be here. It's the only one I can buy. Wait, what if I Wait, we could They come out of the changing room. So, they're going to they're going to come here first, most likely. What we could do or we could bet on them coming down this way and then we just guide them gently. A gentle hand of guidance. [Music] [Music] [Music] Just put these here for now. Trash cans everywhere. Trash cans for everybody everywhere. Another bin. Another bin. It looks pretty bad right now, doesn't it? It There's a saying, it has to get worse. My god. Toilet maze. It has to get worse before it gets better. And right now we are in the um It's got to get better. It's bound to get better. It's horrible. What do you mean? Just got to give it a little bit of time. [Music] We need to hire somebody to restock. [Music] Oh my god, it's beautiful. Okay, simulation ready. You buy a ticket. They say buy ticket. Yay. You go in. [Music] You come out. You go through here. Need another hedge. [Music] and And they go on and they go, "Wow, the water park." The rest of these, uh, exit points are going to be an issue for us. But, uh, it's fine. This is just the start. We have to get rid of all this lemonade. Wow, this looks absolutely god awful.

That is so expensive. It's beautiful. [Music] Okay, we have to unlock the drink vending as well. Nobody really likes lemonade. That's going to be a problem, isn't it? People buy everything in a water park. Yeah. Yes. Yes. There's a line. Oh my god. It's going to be so good. It's going to be so good. Are you kidding me? Excuse me, sir. It's paying dividends. It is. We need more vending machines. Careful, Jake. You've got competition. It says Jake screwed up an order. Caution, Jake. I think I should get rid of the lemonade stand. Anybody want to buy granola?

No. No deaths on property. We are we are holding true to that statistic. There are no deaths on Toilet Town property. You cannot prove anything. I don't want to I don't want to make a scene. But guys, check out how much money we've made. Boring. [Music] Need like three grand. Oh, they don't like the slides. The slides are boring. The police are on their way. Why? What have I done? I'm just an overward CEO, janitor, maintenance man, employee. I'm doing my best. Why don't I put all of the Why don't I put all the trash cans together? [Music] The vending machine. [Music] Welcome to We have to hire an inventory, dude. We have four grand. We can have another one. Oh my god. Okay. Wait. Rest. Wait. I I'm getting too ahead of myself here. Money 2500. 50 people slipped though. That's not very good. It's fine, though. All right, let's do some clean up and then we will reorganize the park a little bit. I think we get rid of these two slides and we put in another big big slide. I think that's what the people want. Maybe. Well, they seem bored of it. That's that's my concern. [Music] We need the mega slide. Yeah. Yeah. [Music] Ah, welcome gifted members. Welcome. Thank you guys for sharing the love. Before Before I jump into buying a bunch of vending machines, is there anything else that I need that I can't ignore? I feel like getting setting up the money flow is really important and I think we are on the right track. A cleaner Well, I don't have to worry about hot dog stands or lemonade anymore. I don't if I hire an inventory person. I don't know if they only stock one. They might only stock one vending machine. We need a lifeguard. Yeah, I think that's somebody that you have to hire. I wonder how much they charge. Let's check their lifeguard. 250 bucks. 212. Not me looking to see if they have Mimi. No. Henry Princeton. What are the odds? Nope. Up. Nope. Maybe another time. That's like five granola sales. You can afford it. That's true. We need another granola maker. Another granola machine. Wait, that's what we need. We need the drink machine. Drink. Oh, it's so much money. Cashier training park size level two. It's so much money. I think we're surviving. I think so far we are surviving. People come to the water park to buy granola. Exactly. [Music] We only have money. We have no decorations. Well, let me Okay, then. Let me just go ahead and buy another vending machine. You know what I'm really happy this game doesn't do is cuz I feel like some games they would every time you buy like a vending machine for example the vending machine would raise in price. So like the first one's 1,200 the second one is 1,800 and then 2500. [Music] Another one. Yeah, I don't I don't like that. But this game doesn't do that. [Music] And that's great. What are people drinking? Pool water. Yes. Yes. [Music] Okay. Wait. Can you Can you buy employees to restock the vending machine? Maybe you can't even do that. Maybe they only restock. Wait, I might have just uh foiled my own plan here. Wait a minute. They don't restock. They only restock hot dog and lemonade. Can you hire employees? What did I say? Bye. Yeah, hire. I bet. I think they only restock hot dog and lemonade. Are you sure? No. You guys know. Well, cuz with the lemon Well, we have to try it now. I have to see efficiency and precision. 82 91 91 91 8292 This is better. But why are you more expensive? Why is Jace less money? Not the vendors. Oh, cuz it's the wrong job. Wait, that's a vendor. Oh, wait. Good eyes. Good eyes. Good eyes. You're right. You're right. You're right. We need the one with the with the box. Didn't I get rid of this? people boo imagine there's no pools actually in the end there's no pools all the lies just to sell you granola it's just sitting area um okay I'm going to get rid of these It's a granola park. Exactly. Yeah, that's a good idea. [Music] Wait, it cost a research point to refresh the list. What? I didn't know that. No, that's why I had zero. Okay, now I know. When you refresh the higher list, it takes away your research points. Okay. Okay. Very funny game. I'm going to They won't steal it, right? If I put it here, why not just bring the inventory closer to me? Welcome to you know. Okay. So, can I steal it? Maybe. We're We're going to know if he's coming though. It'll be fine. We'll hear him coming. Don't hate me, but we're going to put more chairs in. Just a little bit more. Just a little bit. Tiny bit more. We just need a couple more chairs. Saba Mart.

[Music] Yeah, I got to eat sooner or later. Um, what if I put more [Music] Well, we should ride the big slide. That's a good point. Yes, it begins. My turn. My turn. That is a safety hazard. Someone's going to Someone's going to break their neck on that. We just have to be mindful of the slippage here. And if we cover the star the the star rating on the sign and the entrance way. Yeah, we can just lie to people and say we have five stars when we don't. It's foolproof. It's looking a little empty over here. I'm getting a little nervous. We only have 13 people in the park right now. The basic rectangle pools are filthy. Sorry. Are is it the the plus six are the people that didn't pay or they're the people that I uh I inspired them? I think those are the ones that I inspired to come to the park. Vending machine. Anyone? Yes. What if I just trap them in there? Wait, can I place these up on the I need I need to test something. [Music] I can't move these. Why can't I move these? I think these are permanent. [Music] I was I I wasn't The NPC pathing is confused. They don't know where to go, but they're drawn towards it.

Actually, I almost started watching the latest season. Um, I was like, why are they giving me a previously on if this is episode one? And then I thought like, oh, this is like a mind game.

But they didn't. And I was watching the latest season and I'm going to pretend I didn't see things. I luckily I can't really remember what I saw, but I think I I thought I saw something.

[Music] Pretty Little Liars back when I was newer. Um, was on the way, but they they messed that one up pretty bad in my opinion. That's really old though. But it was good and they had the suspense. They had the they had the suspense of who is a but then they just got so I don't know why they did it the way they did. They just took away all the suspense. It's what? It's a good show. It's scary.

Yeah, I can close off the I should I should close off the areas a bit better. I kind of they're kind of just like half kind of just kind of bashed it. I go back in and I will I'll make his little Roomba zone a bit smaller. His Roomba boundaries are too big right now. What's chaos? I left this for like a moment. This park is a huge liability. Uh, maybe, maybe, maybe just a little bit, but just a tiny bit. I keep getting I'm stuck. Okay, no, I'm not. I'm fine. God, I can picture this. This park smells horrendous. It smells like hot bodies, hot garbage. It smells like hot sunburnt human, hot garbage, and hot chlorine. [Music] It smells like me. No, it doesn't. I smell quite all right. Thank you. And granola. No. And it smells like hot electricity from uh the I'm overloading the circuits with all my vending machines. Do you have to plug in a water slide like to your wall or to like with a really long extension cord? Well, yeah, right. So, like the pumps like these definitely are rather filthy. Yeah, like a pump to push the water through. And these especially because they are blow up like an air mattress. Like a big air mattress but with water. I kind of get the taser so that we can taser people in the water. Unless it's a pump with a gas motor. That sounds expensive. [Music] Now that's what I Now that's what I call a lawsuit. Lawsuit seven. Oh, these chairs. They're really good XP points, but they're so annoying. I wonder if you can accidentally tase yourself. That would be pretty funny. One way to find out, am I right? One way to find out. One way to find out. One way to find out. I'm trying to decide what I should eat after this. My options are not great cuz I bought I bought like ground meat to make I was in the mood to make like little stuffed meatloaf things like pan meatloaf stuffed with like vegetables and and sauce. Um, I bought my meat like 2 days ago and it went off. Like it's bad. I am near certain it's bad. Like the the the the plastic around it was all bloated and I it smelt sour. What is ew? And I can't get food poisoning cuz I feel like I got it not that long ago. And I can't come to you guys be like, "Sorry, no stream. I got food poisoning." Cuz I know you'd be like, "Again?" Wasn't that long ago you had it? So yeah, I'm not eating that. I don't think it was discounted. It wasn't slimy, though. Like the bloatedness of the package was instantly going, "Oh, that's not that. That's an instant red flag." And then the smell, but then like ground meat smells funky and there wasn't any slime on it. And like ground meat can also it can go discolored if it if it oxidizes, right? That's why sometimes if you buy meat at the store, it's kind of like grayish brown, but then you open you you like cut into it and it's red as it oxidizes and turns it funky colors. But it's fine to eat. It was gray though. It was like not It wasn't It wasn't Yeah. No. I didn't leave it out. I didn't I put it away. I got sold a scam. Scam meat. Posters. What are we buying? I think posters is a good idea. Um I think a Wait, I need this. Restock staff. I need that. I need that. Five. Janitor training mob upgrade. Extra large. Extra large. But I still can't hire anybody. Wait, where is that? Where is higher? Higher. Hiring level three. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Hiring level three. There we go. That's what I'm talking about. That's what I'm talking about. And I don't have enough. Welcome to Cape. We're a little broke. It's not that bad, though. We can make it back easy. Wait, I can't buy Wait, why did I do that?

He is [Music] [Music] Put all the chairs here and then move all of the pools down a little bit. Is this even worth it? Should I get rid of some of these chairs? I feel like I shouldn't. Well, this park is not very pretty to look at, but it's it's going to make lots of money. And then we can tear down everything and rebuild. Build from scratch. Make it exactly the way that we want it to look. Yes, it'll be perfect. It'll be beautiful. [Music] Toilet village is being moved over here.

Five and a half hours of this hammering sim. Watching streamer take out the trash. Watching streamer mop up a puddle. Well, what else were you going to do on Friday night? This is what I was going to do regardless. I considered like playing a little bit off stream, but I felt I felt like you guys would not be pleased. Not pleased in the slightest. I don't know. Streams like this are kind of fun because it kind of feels like if I'm in your second monitor and you have Wow, this is really sad looking. This is like what you find after a town has been abandoned for over 50 years. What was I saying? I was just like hanging out. Maybe you have another video or some music on the other side that you're listening to. It's nice. It's chill. Sometimes it's nice to have the streams where it's like crazy screaming. Like I understand the entertainment value in that, but um sometimes it's nice just to kind of hang out. It's also nicer on on my mental state if I'm not screaming. Like horror games are fun, but man, do I get tired fast. This is nice though. I like this. Happy fish. Happy fish. The fish is happy. The fish needs a trash baggie. Oh, you're playing your own game. Yeah. What are you playing? Is anybody here playing Rim World? Whim world? Yeah, I'm saving my mental up for October. October. You're playing Silk Song. Kronos. I've heard of Kronos or the Kronos. Satisfactory hell divers. I haven't played the update yet. I have not tried the dragon update. I tried Expedition 33, but I played it on the TV and I didn't I didn't like it. I think it was the It was the way it was formatted to the TV. I couldn't see anything. It was so How am I supposed Are you stalking me? I didn't I just It didn't feel right on the TV. I'd have to try E33 again on the on the old PCs makes you sweat. I'm so bad at it. I'm so terrible. I'm so bad. I like I I want to like dodge roll, but I just feel I feel so helpless cuz in Hell Divers all you can do or all maybe you can unlock something later. All you do is dive out of the way and the fog is so heavy. The fog, man. The fog is so heavy. and you have like I can't dive out of the way fast enough and then by the time I can see what's in front of me, there's like a like a like a a bug in front of me. I'm already dead cuz I got to sit there and reload cuz I decided to use a shotgun and then I have to reload one bullet shell at a time. So I'm going, "Oh my god, I'm lying on my back going fumbling. Click click click click and I can't I can't I die. I die so fast. I wouldn't survive on the front lines. There's fog and hell divers. The Joker from DMC is out there. Coward. Who called me a coward? That's not very That's not very lift up your fellow hell diver, is it? [Music] I think I'm going to upgrade the toilets. I just feel it. I feel No, wait. Oops. Made a decision. I'm upgrading the showers cuz they use the showers more. Sweet Liberty. I haven't been a trader yet. If you become a traitor in Hell Divers, do they throw grenades at you? I was watching gameplay of like highle play and I think somebody was trying to get away from something and they got marked a traitor and then like grenades just kept spawning in front of them. They drop they drop artillery on you. So they do they what or not running outside the map, but like if you run outside of the zone if you're abandoning your hell divers. People use it on purpose. Huh. As like a like a AoE. They can't type in the left, right, left, up, right, left, up, down, down fast enough. If you use mines, if you use mines and hell divers, I don't like you. If you use phosphorus and you don't call it out, you're a or the air strike. I just have no idea. I'm clueless. What am I doing? I'm just running around. I should clean this. It's looking icky. Or the freaking Tesla coil. Uh, showers. No, he cleaned up the poo poo. Peep poo poo. Yeah, the freaking Tesla coils here. By the time you hear it charging up, it's too late for you. Oh [ __ ] A breeze shower. What else can we buy? Some decorations. These all seem kind of L like whatever. They just decorations just seem like they're going to get in the way. A vending machine machine on the other hand. Oh, we do need decorations. Hello. Hello. Ooh, so fancy. Bamboo. Bambooy. So tropical. Oh, wait. Oh, wait. We do need decorations. Okay, we're going to blow the rest of this money on decorations. We need 1,000 freaking points. This is going to be so annoying. [Music] I didn't do any math, by the way. Wait, how many per? 34. [Music] 34 plus. Wait, 30. Wait, 34. Oh my god, I need so many of these. It's almost not even worth it. 25. Oh my Oh my god. Maybe not the best way to go about it. Fix the killer slide.

It's chill day. You're spending it in toilet town. Decorations. Am I missing like a decoration thing? Ah, that might help. Fish freak. Okay, let's see. Okay, what do we got? Oh, there we go. Give me nothing to work with. Bushes. Thanks, game. They're huge. Oh, I know. Then they'll bump into the flower plant flower potter and and then they will ricochet and it will be fine. It will be great. 250 for 38 points. It's hideous. All right, 600 points. Let's test this. So, let's see if it uh helps cuz this way they won't go splat on the sidewalk. They'll bump into the flower potter and the a flower planter planter potter, whatever you call it. Yay. No. Oh my god, it's worse. That's like what happens when you're in a car accident and you have your if you have your feet up on the dashboard and you crash in a head-on collision and then your knees go through your shoulders. Terrible. It passes. Quality control. Send it. Safety pass. Check. Is there anything else I can do for decoration to make it look nicer? To boost these points? I only have 300 coins. 300 monies. I don't have anything else. A I got nothing. Nothing else. I got nothing. Okay, let's see. Hey, you tried to run. It doesn't work, does it? Doesn't work, does it? Yeah. What? Ooh, I thought about it.

Uh have a lovely rest of your Friday and a nice Saturday morning. Okay. I will see you later. Goodbye. Bye-bye. [Music] Kesepian. Kita semua pernah di posisi itu. Scrolling di jam 3.00 pagi ngelihat teman-teman kalian pergi senang-senang, sedangkan kalian duduk sendirian di kamar tanpa siapapun. Merasa terdisconnect dengan kegiatan di luar sana. Seakan-akan di luar kamar kecil kita ini hanya ada void yang akan menatap kalian kembali. Kalian ingin sebuah koneksi, relasi, sesuatu yang bisa menutup rasa hampa yang kalian rasakan. Tapi untuk melakukannya, tubuh kalian terdiam dan takut untuk membuang energi dan emosi untuk menjalaninya. Sebuah titik terendah yang bisa dicapai oleh seseorang. The Non existence of You and Me boleh dibilang mengeksplore pemikiran tersebut. sebuah visual novel game yang penuh dengan konsep filsafat seperti diri sendiri, eksistensialisme, relasi, dan juga rasa menyendiri yang dibungkus dengan seorang anime WFU. Jadi hari ini mari kita bahas [Musik] bagi yang masih belum tahu, The Non existence of You and Me adalah sebuah visual novel hm wangi-wangi RPG dating surrealis philosophis game yang diciptakan oleh Foontain Blue. Jujur aja ini game Absolute Cinema. Dengan harga kurang dari Rp20.000, game ini bisa memberikan kita experience seharga 600.000 lebih bahkan mengubah hidup kalian. Kalau buat saya mah borong aja enggak sih? Seperti yang kalian tahu, ini game adalah sebuah visual novel game. Jadi spesifikasi dasar buat mainin game-nya adalah bisa boc. Tapi saya paham light novel 1 ini punya bahasa yang jujur aja sebagai pengenjoy yapping session di simulator. Lumayan rumit. Kita diajak ngebicarain tentang eksistensi, individualitas, pemahaman di luar relasi, dan aspek filsafat lainnya. Padahal kalau kita sendiri disuruh baca satu kata bahasa Inggris kayak in the in the biningi in the in the kalian paham maksudku kan? Saya sendiri aja harus mainin ini game kurang lebih tiga kali buat bisa mahamin apa maksud dari setiap perkataan lilit. Selain buat ngolexin semua achievement dan juga endingnya, tapi what? Dengan harga satu game kita bisa dapetin tiga experience secara langsung. Lebih mending ini enggak sih daripada si botak? Iya iya ya sudah dua kali, man. Kalau tiga kali saya bisa di pertama-tama story speed run. Kalian adalah seorang noleb mengurung diri dan hanya punya kawan berupa furniture yang bisa ngobrol. Oh, dapat wifu. Dan dari sana kita mendapatkan pertemualangan gila kayak baking kue dan menghentikan pembuatan mesin waktu, menyelamatkan tuan putri dalam sebuah game RPG, dating di taman bermain sampai nonton live konser, dan juga diikat serta dinaikin lilit dan disuapin obat-obatan. Uh, dan kayak gitu doang sih kalau kalian lihat dari luar. Iya, ini kelihatan kayak sebuah kuning game. Tapi pembeda utama dari noneksistent dengan game visual novel lainnya adalah si main heroin sadar kalau dirinya adalah sebuah main karakter. No, no, no, no. Jangan trauma dulu, Boys. Ini game masuk ke rute yang lebih philosophical di Ford wall breaking-nya daripada versi main AI gila. Di game ini, pertanyaan utama yang harus dijawab adalah am I real? Untuk menjawab pertanyaan tersebut, ada tiga jawaban yang bisa kita dapatkan tergantung dengan bagaimana kalian menanggapi tanggapan Lily. Ada the best ending, neutral ending, dan juga you ending. Kalau kalian dapatin yang terakhir, kalian enggak worth it sih untuk mendapatkan kasih sayang Lilit atau mungkin kalian pengin lihat Lilit makan banyak permen sambil diikat. You know, saya juga dapetin ending itu sih pertama-tama ya. Satu rasalah kita. Ini game memanfaatkan Ford W break yang ia punya untuk menjabarkan main message yang dimiliki, yaitu dunia berada di genggaman kita. Maksudnya gimana sih, Bang? Jadi, dunia yang kita alami dan juga rasakan ini dibangun berdasarkan pemahaman dan juga persepsi yang kita simpulkan sendiri. Contohnya begini. Kalau kalian lihat benda ini, well, menurut kalian ini pasti cuma oven biasa. Tapi menurut dirinya dia adalah sebuah mesin waktu. Jadi, kapan Delarun bakal selesai game-nya? Hah? Oh no. Game-nya sendiri sih juga suka memainkan persepsi kita. Di mana jujur aja begitu kita tahu kalau si heroin ini tahu kalau dirinya adalah sebuah game, kita pasti langsung PTSD. Well, kita dipermainkan sih sama game-nya dengan ngasih opsi menguak identitas si Lilit sebagai seorang pembunuh. Well, akhirnya kita tetap dibunuh sih, tapi it's just a joke, man. Come on, Lilit kan bisa godain kita. Come on, goda saya lebih baik. Karena pesan utama dari ini game adalah realita dibangun dari persepsi kita. Pertanyaannya adalah apakah lilit ini nyata atau tidak dalam persepsi kita? Apakah mau dianggap cuma sebagai karakter game biasa yang tidak nyata atau mau dianggap sebagai sosok asli yang sudah berinteraksi dalam hidup kita? Sebelum kita menjawab pertanyaan tersebut, kita bahas dulu wifu-nya. Enggak sih? Lilit ini sendiri boleh dibilang the purest form of love. Beneran nih dia sendiri yang bilang. Dia didesain dengan satu tujuan yaitu untuk mencintai kita. Kalau kalian mau punya pacar pasti habis mainin ini game enggak bakal mau soalnya sudah punya lilit. Gimana enggak? Dia support manis bisa memanipulasi ruang dan waktu. Jahil, seorang princess, seorang game developer, dan bahkan idol. Jjir. Holy Mak aku nak istri idol dan yang paling utama mencintai kalian tanpa memandang imbalan. Saking cintanya Lilit ke kalian, begitu dia ngelihat orang menyendiri yang mulai ngobrol ke furniture, dia berkata, "I bet I can fix him." Dan berhasil. Apapun keputusan kalian terhadap Lilit, ia tidak akan memaksa dan terus mencintai kalian. Entah kalian menganggap dirinya itu asli atau palsu, Lilit tetap mencintai kalian. Karena seluruh dunia Lilit ada pada kalian. Bukan si MC tapi kalian si player bas WFU sudah dan sekarang kita bahas endingnya. Buat saya sendiri sih di game ini enggak ada protagonisnya. Well, yes ada Alex. Tapi ini karakter cuma kaki tangan setiap keputusan kita. Bahkan di final chapter game-nya sendiri si WFU lebih milih ngobrol sama kita daripada dia. Boleh dibilang kita mengntrc-nya. Jadi yang unik dari ini game adalah setiap ending dari gameennya bukan ending dari si MC tapi ending dari kalian si player. Apakah setelah semua kejadian ini kalian masih menganggap lilip sekumpulan satu dan nol yang belok dikit enggak kelihatan atau dirinya sebuah sosok asli yang telah menemani dan meninggalkan sebuah memori? Untuk itu, mari kita lihat endingnya satu persatu. Neutral ending. The existence of you and me. Sebuah ending di mana kalian menerima kenyataan bahwa dunia ini kejam dan sangat gak adil. Dan kalian akhirnya memutuskan buat mengakui keaslian dari lilit, namun memutuskan untuk menghilang dari kenyataan tadi. Jadi, kalian mutusin lilit nyata tapi kalian enggak mau di kenyataan tersebut. Ini ending bisa kalian dapatin kalau kalian main sebagai beta anime MC. Selalu menganggap semua salah kalian dan selalu nyalahin diri sendiri. Salah satu ending yang dark di mana karena cinta kasih yang diberikan oleh Lilit berubah menjadi sebuah panggilan untuk terus lari dari kenyataan dan memutuskan untuk beneran lari dari kenyataan. Kita bahas yang lebih kelam enggak sih? The bad ending, the non existence of you and me. Di mana kita memutuskan untuk menolak eksistensi lilit dan menganggap kalau dirinya ini sebagai sebuah penghalang dari perkembangan kita. Sebuah cinta murni ini tidak ada. dan memberikan efek ilusi atau dongeng seperti cinta lilit hanya akan memperangkap kita dalam dunia perfect yang beracun bagi pemikiran kita dan akhirnya kita membunuh Lilit dengan tangan kita sendiri. literally [Tepuk tangan] untuk ending terakhirnya kita ada the existence of You and me di mana kita menerima Lilit sebagai sebuah kenyataan. Segala pengalaman yang kita hadapi, segala date yang kita nikmati, bukan sekedar sebuah cerita, tapi sebuah motivasi. Sebuah motivasi yang bisa membawa kita untuk berani menghadapi dunia yang kejam ini. Bahkan cinta lilit yang awalnya hanya terhalang dalam sebuah game seakan-akan bisa menembus dimensi dan membawa cinta tersebut ke dunia nyata sebagai bahan bakar kita untuk mengarungi ombak kehidupan. Buat saya sendiri ini ending merupakan ending yang berhasil menggerakkan hati saya. Nangis jir saya habis dua lembar. Dua lembar. Sebuah kisah cinta. Kisah menikmati perjalanan kecil bersama Lilit merupakan tanda yang cukup untuk menunjukkan eksistensinya. Hanya karena dia bisa berada di hidup kita selama 2 jam, Lilit bisa kerasa lebih nyata daripada orang-orang terkenal lain yang tidak pernah kita temui. In short, yes, she is real. Not in the real world, but in my world. Dan walaupun kisah cinta lilit ini too good to be true, itu bukan berarti mustahil. Dengan cinta yang telah ia berikan, setidaknya kita mendapatkan sebuah dorongan untuk mau mencoba lagi. Untuk mencoba jalan menuju dunia yang kejam sekali lagi. Mencari arah yang benar dan sekali lagi mencari lilit atau cinta sejati. Dan mungkin mungkin di sanalah kita bisa bahagia dan melihat senyumannya. [Musik] Ini game boleh dibilang pick storyting kayak game Hello Charlotte, Omori dan bahkan boleh dibilang setingkat anime kayak Finland Sagaf dan bahkan Vagabon. Ini real, sebuah masterpiece dalam harga kurang dari Rp600.000. Dan untuk menutup video ini kayak sebuah anime legend gameennya bakal berkata, "The world is cruel, pada still love you." Kayak biasa, link ada di description dan gilanya lagi ini game ada di HP. Jadi kalian mau main the existence of you and me dan gitu aja boys. Danke. Up next. sebuah game visual novel absurd yang bercerita tentang susu di dalam sebuah susu di dalam sebuah susu di dalam sebuah susu di dalam sebuah susu di dalam sebuah Hello guys kembali lagi di channel Droomp dan selamat datang di plot A Quiet Place The Road Ahead Diadaptasi dari film berjudul A Quiet Place, A Quiet Place The Road Ahead adalah adaptasi versi game yang rilis pada tanggal 17 Oktober tahun 2024 untuk PC, PS5, dan Xbox Series. Cerita dalam game ini bersifat standalone, yang artinya tidak ada kaitan langsung dengan filmnya dan bisa dinikmati meski belum pernah menonton film A Quiet Place. Secara setting, A Quiet Place The Road Ahead mengambil setting waktu mulai dari awal mula kedatangan para monster alien sampai beberapa bulan setelahnya, saat seisi bumi benar – benar menjadi hening dan peradaban manusia mengalami kemerosotan tajam. Bagaimana tidak? Begitu mengeluarkan suara, meski hanya sedikit saja... Sesosok monster mengerikan bernama Death Angel akan langsung menyergap. Untuk itu, tanpa berlama – lama lagi, tahan napas kalian, jangan mengeluarkan suara, dan mari kita mulai pembahasan kisahnya... Semuanya bermula dari tanggal 18 Juni tahun 2020, sang tokoh utama, yaitu seorang wanita bernama Alex, sedang berjalan – jalan bersama sahabatnya, Martin. Alex dan Martin sudah bersahabatan sejak mereka masih kecil, dan kedua orang tua mereka juga saling mengenal baik. Ayah Alex bernama Kenneth adalah seorang dokter, namun ironisnya, istrinya bernama Julia meninggal setelah sekian lama mengidap penyakit berat. Kenneth sempat menyampaikan keinginannya untuk meminjam uang dari orang tua Martin karena ia tidak bisa membayar tagihan rumah sakit. Di sisi lain, Martin terlahir dari keluarga bahagia yang serba ada. Kedua orang tuanya, masing – masing bernama Robert dan Laura, memiliki karir yang baik. Nah suatu hari saat Alex dan Martin menyusuri area hutan, Martin yang mendengar sesuatu tiba – tiba pergi entah kemana, membuat Alex yang khawatir berusaha mencarinya. Pencarian ini membawa Alex masuk ke dalam sebuah rumah tua, namun secara mengejutkan, saat ia keluar melalui jendela dan tidak sengaja melukai tangannya... Martin mengagetkannya. Hal ini membuat Alex menjadi sangat marah, dimana ia mengungkapkan rasa cemasnya tidak ingin kehilangan seorang sahabat setelah kehilangan sang ibu. Di saat itu juga, penyakit asmanya kambuh dan Martin yang tidak pernah mengetahui soal ini karena Alex memang merahasiakannya, langsung menjadi panik. Beruntung, Laura datang di waktu yang tepat untuk menenangkan Alex... Beberapa saat kemudian setelah memastikan Alex baik – baik saja, Laura mengajaknya untuk kembali ke rumah, dan berdasarkan percakapan mereka, terungkap bahwa Alex sebenarnya sudah tidak pernah terkena asma sejak terakhir kali ia masih duduk di bangku SD. Namun belakangan ini, terlebih setelah kehilangan ibunya, penyakit itu kambuh kembali. Hari ini adalah hari ulang tahun Alex, dan untuk itu, keluarga Alex dan Martin berkumpul di halaman rumah Martin untuk merayakannya bersama – sama. Kenneth yang masih tidak bisa merelakan kematian Julia hanya duduk diam dan menenggelamkan rasa sedihnya dengan minum – minum. Saat hendak mengambil persediaan beer, Alex cukup terkejut melihat sebuah shotgun di dalam van milik Laura, sebelum kemudian, Martin memanggilnya untuk meminta maaf. Alex tidak terlalu mempermasalahkan hal ini, dan keduanyapun masuk ke rumah untuk mencari pembuka tutup botol sesuai permintaan Laura. Di tengah pencarian, perhatian Alex teralihkan pada kepingan vinyl milik Laura, vinyl lagu Sprained Heart garapan Alice Caroll. Sebagai pecinta musik, Alex tahu betul betapa langkanya kepingan vinyl tersebut, dan lagu buatannya sendiri terinspirasi dari musik garapan Alice Caroll.. Sadar Alex sangat menyukai vinyl musik, Martin segera membawanya ke area loteng, tempat koleksi vinyl milik ibunya disimpan. Alex benar – benar dibuat terkejut dan kagum oleh sekian banyak vinyl disana, paling tidak sebelum ia melihat berbagai jenis senjata api milik Laura. Seketika itu juga, ia mulai mempertanyakan pekerjaan Laura sebagai pengelola margasatwa, yang dimana Martin menjawab dengan mengatakan bahwa terkadang pekerjaan sebagai pengelola margasatwa juga berarti mengendalikan populasi. Itulah kenapa Laura membutuhkan senjata api. Kenyataan ini menimbulkan sedikit rasa takut di dalam diri Alex Mendengar suara tangisan dan mengintip dari jendela, ia melihat sang ayah sedang menangis di hadapan Laura, mengungkapkan perasaan gagalnya sebagai seorang dokter karena tidak bisa menyelamatkan nyawa istrinya sendiri. Di saat yang bersamaan, bebatuan meteor terlihat jatuh dari langit... Nah sejak hari itu, bumi secara perlahan berubah menjadi neraka bagi umat manusia. Batu meteor yang menghantam beberapa titik mengeluarkan makhluk monster bernama Death Angel yang memiliki kulit menyerupai armor keras di sekujur tubuh mereka. Death Angel mengandalkan kemampuan ekolokasi untuk mendeteksi target dan tidak memiliki penglihatan. Kepanikan terjadi dimana – mana, dan sialnya, monster – monster tersebut mencapai kediaman Martin saat Kenneth sudah pergi untuk bekerja di rumah sakit, sehingga Alex, Martin, Laura, dan Robert, terpisah dengan Kenneth. Laura mengendarai mobil vannya menuju rumah sakit, yang dimana dalam perjalanan, Robert terpaksa harus memberikan Alex sebuah shotgun agar mereka berdua dapat menembak cengkraman tangan Death Angel yang terus berdatangan. Situasi di luar benar – benar kacau, ledakan terjadi dimana – mana, dan semua orang berlari ketakutan. Sampai akhirnya, mobil van mereka tergelincir dan terguling... Bangun – bangun, Alex mendapati Death Angel sedang merangkak memasuki mobil van, dan Laura yang cepat membaca situasi langsung menyuruhnya untuk diam. Mereka semua hampir saja selamat, kalau bukan karena Martin yang mengeluarkan suara saat baru terbangun dari pingsannya. Death Angel langsung bersiap menyerang Martin, namun Alex kemudian menembaknya dan Robert melindungi Alex, membuat Robert berakhir mati di tangan Death Angel... Hanya dalam waktu satu hari, populasi manusia mengalami kemerosotan tajam. Mereka yang bertahan hidup adalah yang cepat membaca situasi, mereka yang dapat hidup dalam keheningan. Pada akhirnya, Alex, Laura, dan Martin mencapai rumah sakit tempat Kenneth berada, dan rumah sakit itu dijadikan sebagai tempat pengungsian setelah dimodifiikasi sedemikian rupa untuk meminimalisir suara yang keluar. Sejak kehilangan suaminya, Laura menjadi orang yang berbeda. Ia selalu menyalahkan Alex atas kematian Robert dan tidak pernah mengizinkan Martin untuk keluar dari rumah sakit. Alex di sisi lain justru menjalin hubungan sebagai sepasang kekasih dengan Martin terlepas dari Laura yang tidak memberikan restu. Sadar ibunya selalu memperlakukan Alex dengan buruk, Martin bahkan sampai membuat surat yang ditujukan pada sang ibu, memohon agar Laura lebih memahami Alex dan memberitahu bahwa Alex selalu menyalahkan dirinya sendiri atas kematian Robert. Padahal saat itu Alex menyelamatkan nyawanya dan Robertlah yang membuat keputusan untuk melindungi Alex. Suatu hari, ingin membantu ibunya dalam menjaga ketersediaan stok makanan di rumah sakit, Martin mengajak Alex untuk pergi mencari makanan di area peternakan yang cukup jauh dari rumah sakit, lagi – lagi mengabaikan larangan ibunya. Di hari ke-105, Alex dan Martin tiba di area peternakan yang dimaksud saat hujan sedang turun, memudahkan mereka untuk bergerak lebih leluasa, mengingat suara yang mereka keluarkan tersamarkan oleh suara hujan. Keduanya berpisah ke tempat yang berbeda untuk mempercepat proses pencarian. Di tengah penelusurannya mengitari kediaman sang peternak, Alex sempat tergelincir, namun beruntung suara petir menyelamatkannya... Mencapai ruang kantor, ia mengambil komponen elektronik dan sebuah peta, namun di saat yang tidak tepat ini, ia tiba – tiba merasa mual. Memang belakangan ini entah kenapa, Alex semakin sering merasa mual, dan lebih buruknya lagi, pil yang ia konsumsi untuk menangani mual sudah habis, tidak memberikannya pilihan lain selain mencari ruang obat. Alex sendiri menduga bahwa ia sedang hamil. Masih di ruangan yang sama, ia juga menemukan sebuah catatan yang merinci soal area perkemahan yang telah diambil alih oleh Garda Nasional, menjadikan tempat itu sebagai harapan bagi mereka yang memerlukan pasokan makanan dan obat. Begitu ia menuruni lobang di kamar yang mengarah langsung ke ruang obat, Alex kembali merasakan mual dan bahkan sampai batuk – batuk. Beruntung, disana ia menemukan obat mual, dan untuk memastikan dugaannya, ia menggunakan test pack. Benar saja, hasil test pack menunjukkan bahwa ia memang sedang hamil... Alex tidak tahu harus senang atau sedih, karena menjadi seorang ibu di dunia yang dipenuhi dengan Death Angel tidak akan mudah. Bagaimanapun juga, tepat saat ia keluar dari ruang obat, ia bertemu dengan Martin yang telah menemukan makanan. Martin kemudian menunjukkan saferoom di basement rumah, tempat yang digunakan oleh orang – orang sebelum mereka untuk bersembunyi. Sembari menyalakan lilin, Alex menemukan catatan dan gambar dari seorang anak kecil bernama Joshie tentang bagaimana ia sangat menyayangi ayahnya. Malam itu, Martin memberikan sarung tangan usang yang ia temukan, dan setelah berpikir sekian lama, Alex akhirnya memutuskan untuk menunjukkan hasil test pack, seketika membuat Martin menjadi sangat bahagia. Hanya saja rasa cemas kembali menyelimuti Alex, membuat asmanya kambuh dan harus ditenangkan menggunakan inhaler. Martin meyakinkan Alex bahwa semuanya akan baik – baik saja. Saat Alex memberitahu soal area perkemahan, Martin membuat rencana, dimana mereka akan membawa makanan kembali ke rumah sakit terlebih dahulu, sebelum nantinya baru pergi ke area itu. Tidur di saferoom dan bangun di keesokan pagi, keduanya bergegas kembali menuju rumah sakit. Namun sial, saat Alex melalui batang pohon yang menghalangi jalan, batang pohon tiba – tiba rusak dan membuat tangannya tersangkut. Suara rusaknya batang pohon memancing kedatangan Death Angel, dan sadar bahwa mereka tidak akan bisa selamat dari makhluk mengerikan tersebut, Martinpun mengorbankan dirinya dengan berteriak memancing sang monster... Dua minggu kemudian, Alex, masih dalam kesedihannya kehilangan Martin, sedang sibuk membuat alat pendeteksi suara bernama phonometer. Kenneth ayahnya datang dan tidak sengaja melihat hasil test pack, tapi ia tidak begitu terkejut karena sudah menduga hal ini, mengingat Kenneth adalah seorang dokter. Keduanya berdiskusi soal apakah mereka perlu memberitahukann soal kehamilan Alex pada Laura Alex tidak mau, sedangkan Kenneth merasa cepat atau lambat Laura pasti akan mengetahuinya. Selain itu, berdasarkan ucapan Kenneth, diketahui juga bahwa sejak kematian Martin, rumah sakit dipimpin oleh seorang pria bernama Mark, orang yang menurut Kenneth dan kebanyakan pengungsi sebagai pemimpin yang tidak becus. Dengan alasan ini, dan sekalian juga untuk menghindari Laura, Alex memberitahu soal area perkemahanan yang dijadikan sebagai pos garda nasional. Ia mengajak ayahnya untuk pergi bersama. Tentu Kenneth tidak bisa membiarkan Alex yang sedang hamil untuk bepergian, namun karena Alex terus mendesak, ia memutuskan untuk mencari bukti keberadaan garda nasional terlebih dahulu menggunakan radio. Sebelum menemukan bukti, mereka tidak akan kemana – mana. Yakin sang ayah akan menemukan bukti, Alex pergi menuju ruang penyimpanan untuk mengambil baterai dan obat mual. Di tengah perjalanan, ia menyaksikan aksi penggeledahan paksa yang dilakukan oleh Mark di kamar para pengungsi karena ada orang yang baru saja mencuri obat – obatan. Alex melewati ruangan itu tanpa ketahuan dan berhasil mencapai ruang penyimpanan, tempat ia menemukan baterai dan obat mual. Namun secara mengejutkan... Mark sudah ada disana. Beruntung, Mark mempercayai alasan Alex yang mengatakan bahwa ia hanya ingin mengecek persediaan obat. Dengan segera, Alex langsung kembali ke ruangannya. Disini bila Alex menyempatkan diri untuk masuk ke ruangan Kenneth, ia bisa menemukan sebuah catatan berisi rincian panjang mengenai berbagai hal tentang Julia yang tidak ingin dilupakan oleh Kenneth, seperti bagaimana Julia memutar rambutnya diantara ibu jari dan jari telunjuk saat sedang berpikir, cara penyebutan espresso yang terdengar seperti ex-spresso, senyumannya saat menyebut Kenneth sebagai kutu buku, kala pertamanya Julia membawa Alex, dan lain sebagainya. Bahkan hingga saat inipun Kenneth masih merindukan Julia. Masuk ke dalam ruangannya, Alex melanjutkan pengerjaan phonometer sampai benar – benar berfungsi, sebelum kemudian, karena kelelahan ia memutuskan untuk tidur... Di luar dugaan, saat terbangun ia mendapati Laura berada di dalam ruangannya sambil memegang test pack. Alex tidak bisa berkata – kata, sedangkan Laura yang baru saja mengetahui bahwa orang yang paling dibencinya sedang mengandung cucunya, mengatakan bahwa ia tidak akan membiarkan Alex menyakiti anggota keluarganya lagi. Laura kemudian berjalan keluar ruangan dan mengunci pintu dari luar... Menunggu sekian lama dan ruangannya tidak kunjung dibukakan, Alex menjadi sangat kesal dan memutuskan untuk kabur melalui ventilasi, namun baru saja membuka satu baut, Kenneth datang untuk membantunya keluar darisana. Sang ayah membukakan sebuah ventilasi, menyuruh Alex untuk masuk ke dalamnya dan mengikuti rel kereta begitu tiba di luar rumah sakit. Sedangkan ia sendiri berusaha menahan Mark dan Laura yang menyadari kaburnya Alex. Melihat bagaimana Kenneth tidak ingin membuka mulut, Mark langsung mendorongnya, membuat Kenneth menabrak pintu di belakangnya dan menjatuhkan benda di ruangan sebelah seketika menciptakan suara keras yang langsung memancing perhatian Death Angel. Alarm rumah sakit menyala sebagai tanda bahaya, dan Alex tidak memiliki pilihan lain selain menelusuri ruangan demi ruangan berupaya mencari jalan keluar. Nah mulai dari titik ini kedepan, kita harus memainkan game dengan sangat berhati – hati. Alex harus memastikan area yang dipijaknya tidak mengeluarkan suara keras dan tidak menyenggol benda – benda kecil. Selain itu, tiap kali ada sesuatu yang mengejutkan, tempat berdebu, atau hal lain yang membuat Alex merasa tidak nyaman, tingkat stressnya akan meningkat. Bila tingkat stressnya mencapai batas akhir, Alex akan mengalami asma dan mulai batuk – batuk, secara tidak langsung memancing Death Angel di sekitarnya. satu – satunya cara untuk meredakan tingkat stress adalah dengan mengonsumsi pil atau menggunakan inhaler. Seisi rumah sakit menjadi sangat kacau. Alex menyaksikan dua orang sedang bersembunyi dan seorang pria yang disergap oleh Death Angel... Mencapai lantai dasar, ia berpapasan dengan Death Angel yang berjalan ke arahnya, sehingga Alex bersembunyi di ruangan sebelah dan menunggu sampai monster itu lewat. Saat ia akhirnya tiba di pintu keluar seorang pria yang panik malah membuat kegaduhan, membuatnya diserang oleh Death Angel dan pintu keluar tertutup oleh lemari yang jatuh... Mustahil bagi Alex untuk mengangkat lemari dan membuka pintu keluar. Maka dari itu, ia harus mencari jalan keluar lain, dan satu – satunya jalan yang terpikir adalah melalui area parkiran. Seolah tidak dibiarkan bernapas legah, Death Angel sedang berkeliaran di area parkiran. Dalam kondisi seperti ini, Alex mau tidak mau harus melewatinya dengan sangat berhati – hati. Pada akhirnya, ia berhasil membuka pintu keluar... Alex menyusuri area hutan selama berjam – jam, berusaha mencari rel kereta sesuai dengan yang dikatakan oleh ayahnya. Di saat yang bersamaan, Laura dan Mark juga terlihat sedang menyusuri area hutan yang sama. Begitu menemukan rel kereta, Alex langsung mengikutinya, dan saat ada celah besar yang menghalangi jalannya, ia menggunakan papan kayu untuk membuat jembatan. Sebuah catatan dari kopral Shibata mengkonfirmasi keberadaan pos garda nasional tidak jauh darisana, namun karena jalur rel kereta terhalang, Alex terpaksa harus mencari jalan putar, tempat ia kemudian menyaksikan kematian Mark... Berpikir jalan putar akan membuang terlalu banyak waktu, Alex memutuskan untuk mengambil jalan pintas melalui sebuah rumah. Kondisi dalam rumah membuatnya merasa sedih, dan ia sangat merindukan ayahnya. Berdasarkan catatan yang tersebar di rumah tersebut, terungkap bahwa rumah itu dulu dihuni oleh seorang pria bernama Daniel dan istrinya, kita sebut saja sebagai Claire. Mereka memiliki seorang anak perempuan bernama Chloe yang sayangnya mengidap sebuah penyakit, mengharuskan Chloe untuk dirawat inap di rumah sakit. Chloe sangat pandai membuat puisi dan bahkan memenangkan beberapa lomba. Saat di rumah sakitpun, ia masih menghabiskan waktunya untuk menulis puisi. Suatu hari, kondisi Chloe semakin melemah, dan di saat – saat ini, ia hanya ingin berada di rumah. Ia ingin tidur di kamarnya dan merasakan kehangatan keluarga, seperti saat kedua orang tuanya menyelimutinya saat ia masih berusia 5 tahun. Bangun di keesokan pagi, ia berharap dapat mencium aroma panekuk buatan ayahnya dan mendengar suara nyanyian ibunya yang sangat bersemangat. Sayang, Chloe tidak bisa mendapatkan semua itu. Hanya satu hari setelah ia menuliskan keinginannya ini Chloe menghembuskan napas terakhirnya di rumah sakit. Nah saat bumi mulai dikuasai oleh Death Angel, Daniel dan Claire bertemu dengan seorang gadis kecil bernama Jill yang tampak sangat kelaparan. Daniel tidak mau membantu Jill, sedangkan Claire yang merasa kasihan memutuskan untuk merawatnya sepenuh hati. Claire memperlakukan Jill seperti putrinya sendiri dan membiarkan Jill untuk menempati kamar Chloe. Seiring berjalannya waktu, Daniel yang mulai menerima kehadiran Jill di dalam keluarga mereka mengajak Jill untuk memancing bersama. Catatan berakhir disini, sehingga kita tidak tahu apa yang terjadi pada keluarga Daniel Setelah membaca semua catatan yang ada, Alex hendak keluar melalui jendela di lantai dua yang mengarah langsung ke halaman belakang rumah, tempat ia kemudian bertemu dengan Laura yang menyuruhnya untuk tetap tenang. Begitu melihat pistol di tangan Laura, ia langsung menjadi panik, membuatnya berakhir jatuh... Keributan mengundang kedatangan Death Angel, dan kali ini Alex menggunakan benda – benda di sekitarnya sebagai distraksi agar ia bisa mengambil papan kayu dan menyebrang ke tempat yang aman. Alex bertanya – tanya, apakah Laura benar – benar ingin menyakitinya? Selama ia mengandung cucu Laura, seharusnya Laura tidak akan berani melakukan itu Bagaimanapun juga, mengambil jalan pintas terbukti sebagai keputusan yang tepat. Alex kembali menemukan rel kereta dan mengikutinya sampai mencapai sebuah stasiun Peta disana menunjukkan bahwa tidak lama lagi ia akan mencapai area perkemahan. Benar saja, mengikuti arahan peta, Alex akhirnya tiba di area perkemahan, hanya untuk mendapati bahwa area itu sudah kosong dan tidak berpenghuni. Ia sudah terlambat. Meski begitu, ia masih belum menyerah, terlebih setelah melihat cahaya yang tampak dinyalamatikan oleh seseorang dari kejauhan. Para panitia penyelanggara acara perkemahan mengalami nasib sial di hari pertama kedatangan Death Angel, dimana mereka semua tidak bisa memanggil bantuan karena adanya kebijakan yang mengharuskan mereka untuk menyimpan HP di dalam kotak yang dikunci. Akibatnya, sebagian besar panitia berakhir mati Mengikuti arahan cahaya, Alex tiba di stasiun radio, dan kabar baiknya, di dalam stasiun tersebut, ia bertemu kembali dengan sang ayah. Kenneth menolak untuk menjelaskan soal luka di kaki kanannya, dan saat ia hendak mengganti sarung tangan Alex, Alex langsung menepis tangannya, tidak mau sarung tangan pemberian Martin diganti begitu saja. Kenneth kemudian memberitahu mengenai sebbuah grup yang baru saja meninggalkan stasiun radio, yang dimana grup itu memberikan frekuensi radio yang diperlukan untuk terhubung dengan seseorang yang mungkin bisa membantu mereka. Masalahnya, antena sedang mati, mengharuskan salah satu dari mereka untuk mengaktifkannya kembali. Mendengar ini, Alex langsung bertekad untuk mengaktifkan antena terlepas dari larangan Kenneth yang mengingatkannya akan kehamilannya. Sadar anaknya tidak akan bisa dibujuk, Kenneth memberikan multitool dan sebuah walkie talkie agar ia bisa membantu mengarahkan Alex menuju antena Multitool dapat digunakan untuk mematikan jebakan suara Kenneth mengarahkan Alex melalui walkie talkie sampai Alex tiba di menara pengawas yang sayangnya tidak memiliki daya listrik. Kondisi ini mengharuskan Alex untuk mengelabuhi pantauan Death Angel agar ia bisa masuk ke dalam gudang dan menyalakan daya listrik. Di dalam gudang terdapat tubuh seorang pria dengan foto gadis kecil bernama Ashley di sampingnya. Sebelum meninggal, sang pria mencurahkan seluruh isi hatinya melalui sebuah catatan, dimana ia mengungkapkan rasa cintanya terhadap Ashley dan bagaimana dunia sudah merenggut kebahagiaan dari putrinya itu. Ia benar – benar membenci semua orang, termasuk para perampok yang mencuri segala hal yang ia miliki dan siapapun yang membaca catatan ini, karena ia yakin orang yang membaca catatan pasti telah mengambil barang milik orang lain yang lebih membutuhkan demi bertahan hidup. Di penghujung catatan, ia bahkan berharap sang pembaca akan tetap bertahan hidup sampai akhir, dan saat sang pembaca percaya akan selamat, harapan itu mati di hadapannya. Alex menaiki menara pengawas dan mengaktifkan antena, seketika menghubungkan radio Kenneth dengan pesan berulang dari regu penyelamat, mengatakan bahwa mereka sedang mempersiapkan beberapa kapal di Pelabuhan Clinton untuk berlayar ke arah timur menuju sebuah pulau. Death Angel tidak akan bisa menggapai mereka karena monster itu tidak bisa berenang Pesan ini membuat Alex dan Kenneth kembali mendapatkan harapan untuk hidup. Tanpa membuang banyak waktu, Alex bergegas kembali ke stasiun radio. Namun di tengah perjalanan, ia mendengar suara Laura melalui walkie talkie, menandakan bahwa Laura baru saja tiba di stasiun radio. Laura menanyakan keberadaan Alex dan berusaha meyakinkan Kenneth bahwa ia hanya ingin memastikan keamanan orang – orang terdekatnya, termasuk Alex. Laura juga menyebut bahwa siapapun yang ada di dekat Alex selalu berakhir celaka, seperti Martin. Sekarang, Alex malah berkeliaran di luar sana padahal sedang mengandung cucunya. Di saat yang tidak tepat ini, pesan berulang dari regu penyelamat muncul kembali, menyadarkan Laura akan rencana Kenneth dan Alex untuk pergi ke Pelabuhan Clinton. Berpikir anaknya bisa berada dalam bahaya, Kenneth langsung berusaha menahan Laura, dan disinilah, Laura tidak sengaja menembakkan pistolnya... Bersamaan dengan itu, Alex mencapai stasiun radio, melihat tubuh tak berdaya sang ayah di hadapan Laura. Suara tembakan pistol juga kemudian mendatangkan Death Angel yang langsung menyerang dan mengejar Laura... Alex hanya bisa menangis di dekat tubuh sang ayah... Untuk sekarang ia harus menyimpan rasa sedihnya dan melanjutkan perjalanan, paling tidak sebeum ia menghindari Death Angel dan mencapai sebuah area dengan aliran air deras yang cukup untuk menutupi suaranya. Di saat itu juga tangisannya langsung pecah... Keesokan pagi, Alex melalui sebuah goa dan mengikuti jalan di tepi sungai yang mengarah ke Pelabuhan Clinton. Ia menggunakan pasir untuk menutupi suara jejaknya, sebelum kemudian mencapai area tempat terjadinya kecelakaan kereta yang selalu dijaga oleh Death Angel. Alex sempat berada di dalam gerbong kereta miring yang jatuh. Namun beruntung, Death Angel tidak menemukannya... Seseorang menuliskan sebuah catatan tentang pengalamannya menghadapi Death Angel yang agak berbeda, dimana monster itu bukan sekadar mendengarnya, melainkan seperti melakukan scan pada lingkungan sekitar. Hening saja tidak akan cukup untuk menghindari Death Angel. Benar saja, menyusuri area berair, Alex mendapati Death Angel yang sedang melakukan scan. Dalam kondisi seperti ini, ia tidak boleh bergerak sama sekali, suara aliran air tidak akan bisa membantunya. Sial, saat mencapai tempat tinggi, ia tidak sengaja menjatuhkan tangga, seketika menyadarkan Death Angel dan memaksanya untuk berlari sekuat tenaga mencari tempat persembunyian. Alex memasuki sebuah celah sempit dan kehilangan kesadaran... Bangun – bangun, ia mendapati dirinya berada di dalam stasiun pompa air, dan karena senternya rusak, ia harus menggantungkan sumber cahaya menggunakan flare. Asap yang keluar dari flare secara perlahan menambah tingkat stress Alex Selain itu, flare juga mengeluarkan suara yang akan memancing perhatian Death Angel, sehingga Alex harus menggunakannya sebijak mungkin. Alex hendak mencari jalan keluar dari stasiun tersebut, lagi – lagi mempertemukannya dengan Death Angel yang harus beberapa kali ia pancing menggunakan flare untuk membukakan jalan... Hampir semua hal di dalam stasiun pompa air mengalami kerusakan, dan coba tebak siapa yang harus memperbaikinya? Sudah jelas Alex. Alex memutar katup, katup, katup, dan ia akhirnya mencapai saferoom setelah hampir tertangkap oleh Death Angel... Merasa mual, ia segera meneguk obat dan menyanyikan lagu untuk anaknya... Disana Alex menemukan catatan dari seorang perawat bernama Kat yang cukup beruntung bisa bergabung bersama garda nasional. Kat membawa seorang anak laki – laki bernama Cameron yang hidup dalam rasa takut, paling tidak sebelum seorang prajurit memberikannya buku tentang kapal. Sejak saat itu, Cameron menjadi anak yang periang, dimana ia sering memainkan mainan kapal bernama Bob untuk mengatasi rasa takutnya. Percaya mereka akan mencapai tempat yang aman dari rasa takut, Cameron sengaja meninggalkan Bob untuk membantu orang lain dalam mengatasi rasa takut mereka Keluar dari saferoom, Alex menguras air kolam dengan memutar katup, katup, dan katup. Darisana, ia akhirnya menemukan jalan keluar dari stasiun pompa... Alex sudah sangat dekat dengan Pelabuhan Clinton. Mengikuti instruksi yang ditinggalkan di dinding, ia mencari cara untuk mencapai toko teknologi. Pintu menuju toko teknologi terkunci menggunakan sistem kunci elektronik, dan karena tidak ada daya listrik, pintu itu tidak bisa dibuka, seperti biasa. Satu – satunya cara untuk menyalakan daya listrik adalah melalui sebuah gudang yang bukan hanya dipenuhi dengan debu, tapi juga dijaga oleh Death Angel Alex memanfaatkan barang sekitar untuk menjauhkan Death Angel darinya, sebelum kemudian ia berhasil menyalakan daya listrik dan keluar dari gudang, memungkinkannya untuk masuk ke dalam toko teknologi. Tepat saat ia masuk ke dalam toko tersebut, ia dikejutkan oleh kedatangan Death Angel, namun beruntung suara melengking dari TV membuat monster itu merasakan kesakitan dan kabur... Alex mencapai sisi lain jalan melalui atap dan memasuki sebuah restoran, tempat ia mengenang kembali masa – masa saat ia sering disuruh oleh orang tua dan kakek neneknya untuk memainkan piano. Disana juga ia menemukan catatan dari pemilik restoran bernama Sean, yang tidak tega meninggalkan restorannya yang sudah susah payah ia bangun selama ini. Hanya saja di saat yang bersamaan ia merasa bertanggungjawab untuk menjaga seorang gadis kecil bernama Zoe yang adalah anak perempuan dari salah satu pengunjung atau staffnya. Mengaggap Sean sebagai sosok ayahnya, Zoe membuat komik yang menggambarkan Sean sebagai pahlawan. Di sisi lain, Sean sadar betul bahwa Zoe harus dibawa ke pelabuhan bersama yang lainnya, dan untuk itu, iapun menitipkan Zoe pada sepasang kekasih bernama Annie dan Lee yang kebetulan melewati restorannya. Sean berjanji pada Zoe bahwa ia akan menyusul, padahal ia tidak berencana untuk pergi ke pelabuhan. Janjinya ini semata – mata hanya untuk membuat Zoe rela pergi meninggalkannya. Sean masih kukuh pada pendiriannya untuk menikmati hari – hari terakhirnya di dalam restoran. Melanjutkan perjalanan menuju pelabuhan, Alex menemukan catatan lain mengenai progres perjalanan Zoe, dimana sepasang kekasih yang membawanya, yaitu Annie dan Lee, berakhir terbunuh di tangan Death Angel, meninggalkan Zoe seorang diri dengan harapan ia dapat bertemu dengan Sean sesegera mungkin. Di titik ini, Alex sadar bahwa ia sudah terlambat, semua kapal di pelabuhan sudah pergi. Meski begitu, menurut sebuah catatan, terungkap bahwa dari sekian banyak kapal yang pergi, hanya tersisa sedikit yang berhasil kabur. Sisanya dihancurkan oleh Death Angel saat berangkat Kenyataan ini tidak membuat Alex menyerah. Belajar dari apa yang ia lihat di toko teknologi, ia memanfaatkan monitor di sekitarnya untuk menciptakan suara lengkingan yang mengganggu pendengaran Death Angel, memberikannya kesempatan untuk melarikan diri. Tiba di ruang CCTV, Alex mendapati salah satu kamera menyotori sebuah kapal di stasiun pemadam kebakaran. Merasa ini adalah satu – satunya jalan keluar yang ia miliki, Alex bergegas menuju stasiun tersebut, tempat ia kemudian menemukan catatan tentang seseorang bernama Reilly yang bertemu dengan Zoe dan memutuskan untuk membantunya. Mengitari area stasiun kebakaran, Alex harus mengaktifkan daya listrik pintu dan gerbang terlebih dahulu, yaitu dengan memasang sekring dan sekring. Secara mengejutkan, saat ia memasang sekring untuk mengaktifkan daya listrik gerbang, percikan api malah muncul dan seisi area mengalami kebakaran hebat. Memperburuk kondisi yang sudah ada, Death Angel datang ke tempat itu, memaksa Alex untuk bergerak perlahan meninggalkan area tersebut sampai mencapai ruang kendali. Kini ia mendapati sistem penyiramnya yang rusak, tapi tenang saja, Alex yang serba bisa berhasil menguras air kolam dengan memutar katup demi katup, sebelum akhirnya mengaktifkan kembali sistem penyiram Dengan aktifnya sistem penyiram, api yang menyulut stasiun berhasil dipadamkan. Namun saat Alex melalui area penuh asap dan hendak membuka gerbang secara manual, asmanya tiba – tiba kambuh, membuatnya berakhir kehilangan kesadaran... Dalam keadaan setengah sadar, Alex mendapati tubuhnya sedang dibawa oleh seseorang ke tempat yang aman, dan di luar dugaan, orang yang menyelamatkannya rupanya adalah Laura. Laura, dengan perutnya yang terluka sebagai akibat dari serangan Death Angel, meminta maaf pada Alex atas perbuatannya pada Kenneth. Sedari awal, ia sebenarnya hanya ingin melindungi Alex dan cucunya. Maka dari itu, kini ia memberikan sebuah masker gas, menyuruh Alex untuk pergi meninggalkan tempat ini. Sadar keretakan hubungan mereka disebabkan oleh kesalahpahaman, Alex membiarkan Laura untuk menyentuh perutnya, tempat Laura sekali lagi meminta maaf dan akhirnya pergi ke tempat lain... Alex mengenakan masker gas yang agak mempersulit napasnya, namun ia memerlukan benda itu untuk melewati area penuh asap di dekat kapal. Ia harus bertahan dari rasa sesak napas yang ia rasakan saat mengenakan masker gas, ditambah lagi dengan adanya Death Angel yang berkeliaran di dekat kapal. Alex memanfaatkan semua benda di sekitarnya untuk melewati makhluk itu, termasuk dengan merusak monitor, membuat distraksi, menggunakan pasir untuk menyamarkan suara, dan menyebrang menggunakan papan kayu. Dengan cara ini, ia berhasil mencapai kapal, dan di saat yang bersamaan, mercusuar mengeluarkan suara keras yang langsung mengalihkan perhatian para Death Angel, memberikan Alex kesempatan untuk menyalakan mesin kapal dan pergi... Meski tidak terlihat, Alex tahu bahwa orang yang membuat suara keras dari mercusuar adalah Laura. Satu Death Angel melompat ke arah kapal dan tenggelam, namun tidak lama kemudian, makhluk itu berhasil berpegangan pada bagian belakang kapal. Beruntung, radio kapal mengeluarkan suara lengkingan keras yang seketika mengganggu dan membuka bagian kepala Death Angel. Sadar ini adalah satu – satunya kesempatan untuk melukai makhluk tersebut, Alex langsung mengambil sebuah shotgun dan menembaknya... Mengikuti arahan dari regu penyelamat, Alex mengarahkan kapal ke arah timur, dan pada keesokan siang, radio akhirnya terhubung dengan seseorang. Di saat itulah, Alex sadar bahwa mimpi buruknya sudah berakhir... Kisah A Quiet Place The Road Ahead berakhir disini. Gamenya memang hanya memiliki satu ending dan secara keseluruhan berfokus pada usaha Alex untuk melarikan diri. Meski Alex berhasil selamat, namun ia telah kehilangan orang – orang terdekatnya. Senior narrative designer dari game ini bernama Luca Esposito sendiri mengatakan bahwa A Quiet Place bukan hanya sekadar tentang horror, melainkan juga mengenai kemanusiaan. Kita bisa melihat perubahan sifat dan perilaku manusia sebelum bumi dilanda kehanncuran dan setelahnya. Perubahan yang paling terlihat dalam game ini adalah karakter Laura yang tiba – tiba begitu membenci Alex. Esposito menjelaskan sebuah kesalahan akan terjadi saat manusia tidak bisa saling berkomunikasi dengan baik, persis dengan apa yang terjadi diantara Alex dan Laura yang penuh dengan kesalahpahaman. Selain itu, untuk menonjolkan sisi kemanusiaan lebih jauh, A Quiet Place The Road Ahead juga memberikan backstory pada tiap tempat yang dilalui oleh Alex. Itulah kenapa kami juga membahas beberapa kisah dalam tiap catatan yang ditemukan oleh Alex di sepanjang perjalanannya Kira – kira begitulah kisah yang coba dibawakan oleh game A Quiet Place The Road Ahead.

And see you guys in the next video. Stay Romp Hello guys kembali lagi di Channel Droomp dan Selamat datang di Plot Silent Hill 2 Remake Silent Hill 2 yang pertama kali dirilis pada tahun 2001 telah dinobatkan sebagai game Silent Hill terbaik oleh kebanyakan fansnya. Bagaimana tidak? Keseluruhan game ini benar-benar menggambarkan apa itu Silent Hill dan bagaimana elemen di dalamnya dapat menakuti kita sebagai pemain. Untuk itu, Bloober Team, developer dibalik game Layers of Fear, The Medium, Observer, dan Blair Witch, dipercayakan oleh Konami untuk menggarap versi Remakenya yang telah rilis pada tanggal 8 Oktober tahun 2024 kemarin. Secara keseluruhan, cerita yang dibawakan masih sama, yaitu mengenai perjuangan seorang pria bernama James Sunderland dalam mencari istrinya, Mary, di kota Silent Hill. Namun tentu dengan perombakan grafis, gameplay, dan beberapa detail baru di sepanjang game seperti script, puzzle, dan 2 ending baru. Plot Silent Hill series sendiri sebenarnya sudah pernah kami bahas sekitar 3 tahun yang lalu, untuk sekarang, kita akan fokus membahas plot Silent Hill 2 Remake. James Sunderland menerima surat misterius dari istrinya, Mary, yang sudah meninggal 3 tahun lalu karena menderita penyakit terminal. Surat itu menyatakan Mary sedang menunggunya di tempat spesial mereka berdua di kota Silent Hill, yang dimana pernyataan ini membuat James kebingungan, karena menurutnya, seluruh kota Silent Hill adalah tempat spesial mereka. Meski tidak yakin surat itu benar-benar ditulis oleh Mary, ia berangkat ke kota Silent Hill untuk mencarinya. Namun karena jalan utama terblokir, ia berhenti sebentar di dek observasi untuk membersihkan wajah di kamar mandi... Berjalan melalui jalur pejalan kaki yang diselimuti oleh kabut tebal, James mencapai area pemakaman dan bertemu dengan seorang wanita gugup bernama Angela Orosco yang menunjukkan jalan menuju kota Silent Hill. Namun ia kemudian memperingatkan bahwa ada sesuatu yang tidak beres di kota itu, sesuatu yang tidak bisa dijelaskan. James mengabaikan peringatannya, mengatakan bukannya ia tidak mempercayai perkataan Angela, melainkan karena ia hanya sudah tidak peduli lagi, bahaya atau tidak, ia tetap akan pergi ke kota Silent Hill untuk mencari seseorang yang sangat penting baginya. Mendengar ini, Angela mengaku ia juga datang untuk mencari seseorang yang sangat penting, ibunya. Ia sudah lama tidak bertemu dengan ibunya, dan ia pikir ayah dan saudaranya ada disini, tapi ia tidak bisa menemukan mereka berdua. Setelah pertemuan yang canggung, keduanya saling mengharapkan untuk bisa mencapai tujuannya masing-masing. James mengikuti arahan Angela untuk menempuh satu-satunya jalan menuju kota Silent Hill, dimana setibanya disana, ia menemukan sebuah peta dan mendapati kota itu dalam keadaan terbengkalai dengan keberadaan kabut aneh yang menyelimuti seluruh area dan dinding tinggi yang memblokir beberapa jalan. Lebih anehnya lagi, di tengah penelusuran, ia melhat sesosok makhluk yang berjalan dengan sangat aneh dan meninggalkan bekas darah di lantai. Ingin mencari tahu apa yang terjadi, James mengikuti bekas darah di lantai yang membawanya ke sebuah rumah, tempat ia menemukan radio rusak yang hanya mengeluarkan suara statik dan dikejutkan oleh keberadaan sesosok monster bernama ‘Lying Figure’. Situasi ini memaksa James untuk menggunakan papan kayu sebagai senjata dalam menghadapinya. James sadar radio hanya akan mengeluarkan statik ketika ada monster di dekatnya, sehingga ia menyimpan radio itu di sepanjang perjalanan. Melompat keluar jendela, radio mengeluarkan suara putus-putus dari seorang wanita yang memanggil nama James dan memintanya untuk datang ke suatu tempat, suara yang dikenali oleh James sebagai suara istrinya, Mary. Entah apa yang terjadi, namun James kemudian menemukan korek api Neely’s Bar di jalanan yang seolah memberikan petunjuk baginya untuk pergi kesana, tempat ia menemukan Jukebox dan memperbaikinya menggunakan berbagai peralatan yang telah ia kumpulkan di sekitar kota Silent Hill, seperti lem dan setengah kepingan Vinyl di toko musik, tombol angka 2 di dalam lubang Saul Street Apartment kamar nomor 9, dan koin Neely’s Bar di mesin kasir Texan Cafe. Berhasil memperbaikinya, James menggabungkan kepingan vinyl berjudul “The Long Way Home” dan memutarnya di Jukebox, memperdengarkan lantunan nada lembut yang seketika mengingatkannya kembali pada kenangan ketika ia dan Mary menghabiskan waktu di area taman Rosewater Park... Percaya Rosewater Park adalah tempat spesial yang dimaksud di surat, James bergegas pergi melalui pintu belakang Neely’s Bar dan menemukan kunci menuju Wood Side Apartment di dekat mobil berwarna hijau kebiruan, dimana tepat pada saat ia mengambilnya, sekumpulan monster tiba-tiba datang menyerang, memaksanya untuk melarikan diri hingga mencapai Wood Side Apartment. Karena jalan menuju Rosewater Park terblokir, James tidak memiliki pilihan lain selain mencari jalur alternatif melalui Wood Side Apartment. Disana ia mengalami berbagai kejadian tak terduga, seperti diserang oleh monster Mannequin hanya sesaat setelah mengambil flashlight; menemukan pakaian Mary di ruang 202; diganggu oleh gadis kecil yang menginjak tangannya saat ia hendak meraih sebuah kunci; menemukan pistol di ruang 217 yang dipenuhi dengan lubang tembakan di dinding; mendapati tubuh seorang pria terduduk mati tepat di depan tv statik, yang dimana James ragu membuka kain yang menutupi wajah sang pria; dan menemukan mayat di kulkas ruang 216. Di ruangan yang sama, James mendengar suara muntahan seseorang dari dalam kamar mandi, dan saat pergi memeriksa, ia bertemu dengan seorang pria bernama Eddie Dombrowski yang langsung mengelak mengatakan bukan dia yang membunuh pria di kulkas, melainkan sang pria sudah mati saat ia memasuki ruangan ini. James segera menenangkannya dan menebak dengan benar alasan Eddie berada di kota Silent Hill, yaitu karena ada sesuatu yang membawanya kesini. Eddie memberitahu bahwa ia dikejar oleh sekumpulan orang yang memaksanya untuk melarikan diri dan bersembunyi di dalam kamar mandi. Mendengar ini, James menyarankan Eddie untuk pergi dari kota Silent Hill, mengklaim ada sesuatu yang benar-benar tidak beres disini, namun saat Eddie mengajaknya mencari jalan keluar bersama-sama, James menolak dengan alasan ia masih harus mencari seseorang. Untuk itu setelah memperingatkan Eddie untuk berhati-hati, ia melanjutkan penelusurannya terhadap Wood Side Apartment. Setelah sempat diawasi oleh Pyramid Head dari sisi lain jeruji, James memasuki ruang 201 dan menemukan sapu tangan yang membuatnya terdiam untuk sesaat, paling tidak sebelum monster Mannequin terjatuh tepat di belakangnya. Sebelum bisa memeriksa, ia terkejut mendapati Pyramid Head sedang... “bermain” dengan Mannequin lain, memaksanya untuk bersembunyi di dalam lemari. Sial setelah puas bermain, Pyramid Head dapat merasakan kehadiran James dan berjalan mendekat ke arah lemari, tidak memberikan James pilihan lain selain menembakkan pistolnya beberapa kali. Cara ini terbukti ampuh, setelah mengeram kesakitan, Pyramid Head pergi meninggalkan ruangan itu sambil menyeret tubuh salah satu Mannequin... Membuka pintu merah di ruangan yang sama, James menyadari celah yang memisahkan Wood Side Apartment dengan Blue Creek Apartment, dan setelah melangkahkan kaki ke Blue Creek Apartment, ia mendapati lingkungan sekitar berubah menjadi gelap dan mengerikan. Ini adalah Otherworld, alam alternatif yang terletak di perbatasan antara kenyataan dan ketidaknyataan, suatu tempat yang dekat sekaligus jauh. Tidak ada kata-kata yang bisa menjelaskan apa itu Otherworld secara pasti, tapi alam ini dipercaya terbentuk dari pikiran dan jiwa orang yang memasukinya, biasanya dengan tujuan untuk menciptakan limbo mereka sendiri atau penebusan dosa mereka. Menelusuri lorong-lorong yang dipenuhi dengan retakan dan besi berkarat, James tidak sengaja bertemu dengan Angela yang terlihat sedang berbaring ke arah cermin sambil menggenggam sebuah pisau di tangannya. Sadar Angela berusaha menyakiti dirinya sendiri, James mencoba membujuknya untuk mengurungkan niatannya itu, namun disini Angela benar-benar seperti orang yang mengalami trauma berat dengan setiap perkataannya yang terdengar sangat tidak masuk akal. Ia berbicara tentang bagaimana mereka berdua pantas mati, dan ketika James mengatakan ia tidak sama dengan Angela, Angela langsung meminta maaf. Baik James maupun Angela belum menemukan orang yang mereka cari, namun saat James menyodorkan foto Mary dan memberitahu bahwa istrinya itu sebenarnya sudah meninggal 3 tahun yang lalu, Angela tiba-tiba menjadi panik dan mengatakan bahwa ia harus pergi melanjutkan pencariannya terhadap sang ibu. Angela menolak tawaran James untuk pergi bersama-sama dan meninggalkan pisau yang ia genggam di ruangan itu meski ada sedikit konflik dalam dirinya... James menyimpan pisau Angela dan harus berhadapan dengan Pyramid Head sebelum mencapai jalan keluar, dimana setelah selang beberapa waktu, suara sirene terdengar dan Pyramid Head pergi begitu saja... Suara sirene sendiri menandai transisi dari Otherworld ke realita atau sebaliknya, sehingga saat James keluar dari Blue Creek Apartment, keadaan sekitar sudah kembali normal. Ia bertemu dengan gadis kecil sama yang sebelumnya menginjak tangannya di Wood Side Apartment. Sang gadis, bernama Laura, sedang menggenggam sebuah surat di tangannya, dan saat ditanyakan apa isinya, ia menolak memberitahu dan pergi ke sisi lain tembok sambil menyebut nama Mary, mengatakan James tidak pernah mencintai Mary. James terkejut dan kebingungan, bagaimana bisa Laura mengenali istrinya? Berjalan tidak jauh dari sana, tibalah James di Rosewater Park, area taman yang ia yakini sebagai tempat spesial yang dimaksud di surat Mary. Ia mulai bertanya-tanya dalam dirinya, apakah Mary benar-benar menunggunya disini? Benar saja, berjalan menuju gazebo, James melihat seorang wanita dengan figur tubuh mirip istrinya sedang menatap ke arah danau Toluca, namun saat sang wanita menoleh ke belakang, ia sadar wanita itu bukan Mary. Sang wanita mengenalkan diri sebagai Maria, dan James dibuat bingung ketika ia menyadari banyak kesamaan di antara Maria dan istrinya, mulai dari wajah, suara, hingga figur tubuh, hanya saja Maria memiliki sikap yang lebih agresif dan cara berpenampilan yang lebih terbuka. Meski mengetahui kenyataan bahwa Mary sudah meninggal 3 tahun yang lalu, Maria bersedia membantu mempertemukan James dengan Mary di tempat spesial mereka berdua, mengklaim ia tahu sebuah tempat tidak jauh dari sini yang biasa disebut ‘spesial’ oleh sepasang kekasih. Setelah sempat hampir tergoda oleh Maria, James memutuskan untuk mengikuti arahannya. Mereka harus melewati motel ‘Jacks Inn’, dimana disini jika kita memasuki ruang 106, James akan mengatakan ada sesuatu yang tidak beres disini. Ini adalah easter egg untuk game Silent Hill 3, karena pada satu titik, Heather, sang protagonis utama, menjadikan ruang 106 Jacks Inn sebagai tempat pertemuannya. Bahkan kita juga bisa menemukan lambang save point Silent Hill 3 tersembunyi di balik wallpaper dinding. Selain itu, di ruang 108, Maria menemukan pakaian yang ia kenakan di Silent Hill 2 original. Keluar dari area motel Jacks Inn, jika kita mencapai halaman depan sebuah mansion, Maria tidak akan berani ikut masuk, mengklaim ia merasa takut dengan tempat itu. Maria takut bukan tanpa alasan, melainkan karena mansion yang kita kunjungi adalah Baldwin Mansion, setting utama dalam Side Story Silent Hill 2 Original berjudul Born From a Wish. Dalam skenario itu, kita mengambil sudut pandang Maria sebelum bertemu dengan James di Rosewater Park. Nah selama eksplorasinya di Baldwin Mansion, Maria mengalami berbagai kejadian mengerikan. Tapi disini saat James menanyakan apa yang terjadi, ia mengaku tidak ingat, hanya merasa familiar dan seperti mengingatkannya kembali pada memori yang buruk. Bagaimanapun juga, karena jalan utama runtuh, James dan Maria harus mengambil jalan putar melalui sebuah gang dekat sana, dimana atas desakan 3 monster Lying Figure yang berjalan mendekat secara perlahan, James mendorong gerbang yang tersangkut sekuat tenaga dan menguncinya menggunakan papan kayu yang selama ini ia gunakan sebagai senjata. Ia menggantikannya dengan pipa yang kebetulan tersangkut di mobil rusak, namun sial, situasi tiba-tiba menjadi kacau balau, badai angin melanda dan monster bermunculan dalam jumlah yang tidak sedikit. Beruntung dengan bantuan Maria, mereka berhasil menyelamatkan diri dan mencapai klub Heaven’s Night... Maria memasuki area backstage untuk tampil sebagai penari tiang di panggung, yang dimana James tidak menanggapi hal itu dengan baik dan malah bertanya dengan perasaan kecewa, apakah ini yang dimaksud oleh Maria dengan tempat spesial? Maria tidak mengiyakannya, mengklaim tempat spesial yang ia maksud ada di luar klub, tapi mumpung sekarang mereka ada disini, ia mengajak James untuk beristirahat sejenak, hanya untuk sekali lagi membuat James kesal berpikir Maria hanya ingin bermain-main dengannya, sementara Mary sendiri mungkin sedang menunggunya di suatu tempat di luar sana. Maria seketika mencurahkan isi hatinya, tentang bagaimana semua hal yang terjadi sudah seperti mimpi buruk baginya dan ia hanya ingin waktu untuk menjernihkan pikiran. Mendengar ini, James segera meminta maaf dan menanyakan pendapat Maria, apakah ia gila berpikir istrinya yang sudah meninggal masih menunggunya disini, namun tidak sesuai dugaan, Maria melihatnya sebagai harapan, jawaban yang membuat James cukup terkejut. Maria menuangkan 2 gelas alkohol dan James menolak... Cukup beristriahat, James dan Maria keluar melalui pintu belakang klub yang membawa mereka ke sisi lain jurang dan membuka gerbang menuju Moonlight Grove, area taman yang dimaksud oleh Maria sebagai tempat spesial, dimana disana ia menyampaikan sebuah legenda lokal berjudul ‘The Lady of the Light’, mengisahkan tentang seorang wanita yang diusir ke pulau terpencil sebagai bentuk hukuman mati, namun mendapatkan bantuan dari seorang pria yang jatuh cinta padanya. Sang pria rela mendayung melintasi danau setiap malam untuk membawakan makanan dan menemaninya, sedangkan sang wanita sendiri akan berdiri di pesisir pantai sambil menggenggam sebuah lilin untuk menuntun arah sang pria. Namun pada suatu hari, badai dahsyat terjadi, memadamkan lilin yang dibawa oleh sang wanita. Meski tidak bisa melihat apapun di tengah kegelapan, sang pria tidak menyerah, ia terus mendayung dan mendayung, hingga akhirnya amukan air menenggelamkan dan menewaskannya. Kabarnya sang wanita tidak pernah hilang harapan dan tetap berdiri di pesisir pantai setiap malam sambil menggenggam sebuah liln. Maria tidak tahu apakah ada kebenaran di balik cerita itu atau hanya karangan belaka, namun satu hal yang pasti adalah sang wanita dijadikan sebagai simbol cinta abadi oleh warga setempat. James, di sisi lain, tidaknya terhibur, ia malah mulai frustasi mengetahui bahwa Mary tidak ada disini. Kenyataannya ia bahkan tidak pernah mengunjungi tempat ini sebelumnya. Di saat James merasa putus asa, Maria menenangkannya dengan mengatakan bahwa mereka masih bisa mencari ke tempat lain. Namun tepat pada saat itu, suara teriakan seorang gadis terdengar dari gedung teater, dan karena pintu masuk terblokir, James terpaksa masuk melalui jendela pecah yang mengarahkannya ke ruang penyimpanan, meninggalkan Maria di luar. James dapat mendengar perbincangan antara Eddie dan Laura di studio, dimana melalui perbincangan ini, diketahui bahwa rupanya suara jeritan barusan adalah suara Laura yang menjerit ketakutan ketika seekor tikus melompat ke arahnya dari bawah kursi bioskop. Namun satu hal yang menarik disini adalah pengakuan Eddie tentang bagaimana ia dikejar oleh polisi dan memutuskan untuk membarikade pintu masuk bioskop agar tidak ada orang yang bisa mengejarnya. Ini mengungkap sedikit motifnya yang nanti akan kita bahas lebih detail di babak penjelasan. Untuk keluar dari ruang penyimpanan, James harus mendorong lemari yang menghalangi pintu, tapi suara keras yang ditimbulkan menyadarkan Laura akan keberadaannya, sehingga saat James tiba di studio, ia hanya mendapati Eddie terduduk seorang diri sedang enak menyantap popcorn sehabis pizza. Eddie tampaknya tidak pernah peduli dengan rencana melarikan diri dari kota Silent Hill, dan saat ditanyakan apakah dia hanya sendirian disini, proyektor bioskop tiba-tiba mati, dan menurut Eddie, itu adalah ulah Laura. Ingin mencari tahu bagaimana Laura bisa mengenali Mary, James bergegas mengejarnya ke ruang proyektor, namun Laura segera melarikan diri dari gedung teater, mengabaikan peringatan James akan bahaya yang mengintai di luar. Maria memberitahu kemana Laura pergi, dan bersama James, ia menyusul ke Brookhaven Hospital, gedung rumah sakit yang didirikan pada tahun 1810 dan telah mengalami banyak pengalihfungsian, dimulai dari koloni hukuman, rumah sakit medis, hingga ke rumah sakit jiwa. James menemukan Laura sedang mencoret-coret tembok di ruang tangga namun Laura sekali lagi melarikan diri dan mengunci pintu menuju lantai 2, memaksa James untuk mengejarnya menggunakan elevator yang daya listriknya harus dinyalakan terlebih dahulu melalui area basement. Setibanya di lantai 2, James menyadari langit sudah gelap hanya dalam sekejap, namun yang membuatnya khawatir adalah Maria yang tiba-tiba saja jatuh sakit. Untuk itu sementara Maria beristirahat di ruang C5, James melanjutkan pencariannya pada Laura. Disinilah untuk pertama kali, James berhadapan dengan monster perawat bernama Bubble Head Nurse. Setelah sempat melihat Laura di lantai 3 yang lagi-lagi melarikan diri begitu menyadari keberadaan James, James memperoleh kunci menuju area atap, namun sebelum itu, ia menyempatkan diri untuk memeriksa kondisi Maria, hanya untuk mendapati ruang C5 dalam keadaan kosong... Mencapai area atap, James dikejutkan oleh kehadiran Pyramid Head yang langsung mencekik dan melemparnya jatuh ke lantai 3, tempat ia akhirnya bertemu Laura dan berkesempatan berbicara dengannya. Saat ditanyakan bagaimana ia bisa mengenali Mary, Laura memberitahu bahwa Mary adalah temannya dan mereka bertemu di rumah sakit satu tahun lalu, yang dimana seketika mendengar ini, James langsung menjadi marah besar, meminta Laura berhenti berbohong, mengingat sepengetahuannya, Mary sudah meninggal 3 tahun yang lalu. Merasa tidak dipercaya, Laura mencoba kabur namun berhasil dihentikan oleh James yang mengkhawatirkan keselamatannya. James mengajak Laura keluar dari rumah sakit ini, tapi Laura menolak, mengklaim ia masih harus mengambil sesuatu yang penting sebelum keluar, dan sesuatu yang penting itu adalah surat peninggalan Mary yang ia sembunyikan di sebuah ruangan dekat sana. Penasaran dengan isi surat peninggalan Mary, James segera memeriksa ke ruangan yang dimaksud, tidak menyadari bahwa ia telah masuk ke dalam perangkap Laura yang kemudian mengurungnya di ruangan itu. Keusilannya ini ia lakukan atas dasar kemarahan karena James tidak mempercayai perkataannya tadi. Sial James tidak sendirian di *ruangan itu. Sesosok monster mengerikan bernama Flesh Lip menampakkan diri dari atap dan mulai menyerang, memaksanya untuk melawan balik, namun setelah berhasil ditumbangkan, Flesh Lip lain datang merenggut James hingga kehilangan kesadaran. Dalam kondisi setengah sadar, suara sirene terdengar, menandai peralihan dunia, sehingga saat mendapatkan kembali kesadarannya, James sudah berpindah ke Otherworld Brookhaven Hospital. Disana ia menemukan tombol elevator menuju basement dari sebuah pintu khusus yang disebut sebagai Lady of the Door. Disebut sebagai Lady of the Door karena pintu ini didekorasi dengan patung wanita timbul dan hanya bisa dibuka dengan menggunakan 2 cincin khusus. James memasangkan tombol -1 pada elevator dan menekannya, dimana sebelum elevator mulai bergerak turun, radio tiba-tiba menyiarkan kuis Halloween. Ini hanyalah bagian bonus untuk mendapatkan supply tambahan jika kita berhasil menjawabnya dengan benar. Di area basement tepat pada saat James menemukan salah satu cincin yang diperlukan untuk membuka Lady of the Door, Maria datang memanggil, membuat James salah mengiranya sebagai Mary untuk sesaat. Kenyataan ini membuat Maria marah, menuduh James telah meninggalkannya sendirian dan tidak pernah peduli padanya, satu-satunya orang yang dipedulikan oleh James hanyalah Mary yang bahkan sudah tidak ada. Maria kemudian menenangkan diri dan bersandar pada James, memintanya untuk jangan pernah meninggalkannya sendirian lagi. Ia bertanya soal Laura, dan saat mendengar bahwa Laura melarikan diri sekali lagi, ia langsung menunjukkan kepeduliannya, mengatakan mereka harus segera menemukan Laura. Hal ini membuat James kebingungan, kenapa Maria begitu peduli pada Laura, apakah mereka saling mengenal satu sama lain? Maria mengaku ia tidak pernah bertemu dengan Laura sebelumnya, tapi entah kenapa, ia selalu merasa kasihan pada gadis itu dan berpikir ia seharusnya melindunginya. Meski tidak mengerti apa yang dimaksud oleh Maria, James melanjutkan pencariannya terhadap Laura di area basement. Mereka menemukan cincin kedua di dalam peti dan menggunakan kedua cincin tersebut untuk membuka Lady of the Door, mengungkap lorong sempit dan gelap yang berliku-liku. Sementara James berpikir ini adalah satu-satunya jalan keluar dari rumah sakit, Maria enggan masuk dan menjadi sangat gelisah, mengatakan ada sesuatu yang tidak beres di dalam sana, paling tidak sebelum James menawarkan tangannya dan meyakinkannya untuk tidak takut. Kegelisahan Maria dengan cepat terbukti benar ketika di tengah perjalanan, mereka tiba-tiba mendengar suara gebukan yang sangat keras dari pintu diikuti oleh suara seretan besi. Itu adalah suara yang berasal dari Pyramid Head... James dan Maria berlari sekencang mungkin melalui lorong demi lorong hingga mencapai sebuah elevator. Namun sayang, Maria sempat terjatuh, memaksa James untuk menahankan pintu elevator yang macet. Ketika mereka berdua berusaha membuka pintu elevator... Maria terbunuh oleh Pyramid Head tepat di hadapan James... James bersedih atas kematian Maria, namun ia tahu ia tidak boleh terlalu lama berlarut karena masih harus mengejar Laura yang kini terlihat sedang berlari di luar gedung rumah sakit. Sayang minimnya penerangan di luar membuat James kesulitan mencari keberadaan Laura. Ia malah menemukan petunjuk lain di sebuah peta yang mengarahkannya ke suatu tempat, dimana di tengah perjalanan, James sempat melihat pesan ancaman yang ditujukan padanya tertulis di dinding Neely’s Bar, berisi usulan agar James mati saja jika ingin bertemu dengan Mary. Sang penulis yakin James tidak akan berakhir di tempat yang sama dengan Mary, seolah menyiratkan bahwa James akan berakhir di neraka. Tulisan ini ditulis dengan abjad yang tidak beraturan. Bagaimanapun juga, setibanya di lokasi yang ditandai di peta, James mendapati telepon umum sedang berdering dan mengangkatnya, namun saat ia menutupnya karena tidak mendengar suara apapun, selembar kertas catatan yang ditekuk keluar dari lubang pengembalian koin, berisi informasi tentang sebuah kunci yang dapat ditemukan di dekat patung wanita di Rosewater Park. Diletakkan di dekat sana adalah sebuah kunci pas yang kemudian digunakan oleh James untuk membuka gerbang menuju Rosewater Park, tempat ia harus menghindari serangan monster bernama Mandarin yang bergelantungan di sisi lain lantai berjeruji dan akhirnya mencapai patung wanita yang dimaksud. Disana ia tidak sengaja bertemu dengan Angela yang tampak sedang berputus asa karena tak kunjung menemukan ibunya, berpikir sang ibu tidak ingin menemuinya lagi. Ia juga menolak penawaran James untuk bersama-sama mencari jalan keluar dari kota Silent Hill, namun aneh, saat ditanyakan mengenai keberadaan seorang gadis kecil alias Laura, Angela tiba-tiba saja diliputi oleh perasaan takut dan melarikan diri dari sana... James memperoleh kunci menuju Silent Hill Historical Society, museum sejarah yang didirikan untuk menampung berbagai informasi mengenai masa lalu kota Silent Hill, seperti legenda lokal The Lady of the Light, yaitu cerita sama yang disampaikan oleh Maria di Moonlight Grove, tapi bedanya, disini diceritakan lebih lengkap dan agak berbeda. Dijelaskan bahwa sang wanita diusir ke pulau terpencil sebagai bentuk hukuman mati karena dituduh sebagai seorang penyihir. Sang pria yang jatuh cinta padanya juga bukan tewas karena badai kencang dan air yang mengamuk, melainkan karena ia disesatkan oleh cahaya bulan yang sangat terang hingga akhirnya ia kelelahan dan tenggelam. Selain legenda lokal The Lady of the Light, ada juga foto kapal Little Baroness yang menghilang secara misterius di Toluca Lake pada tahun 1916 dan area pertambangan Wiltse Coal Mine yang didirikan pada tahun 1850. Di bagian belakang museum, James menemukan semacam galian terowongan yang sangat gelap dan menurun, dimana setelah berjalan sekian lama di terowongan yang seolah tak ada ujungnya itu, tibalah ia di Toluca Prison. Toluca Prison adalah sebuah penjara yang didirikan pada tahun 1862 dan difungsikan sebagai kamp konsentrasi selama Perang Saudara Amerika terjadi, sebelum kemudian dialihfungsikan menjadi penjara biasa pada tahun 1866. Meski akhirnya ditutup pada tahun 1900-an tanpa alasan yang jelas, banyak bukti yang menyiratkan bahwa penjara ini biasa digunakan sebagai tempat eksekusi. Tiang gantungan digunakan sebagai salah satu metode hukuman mati pada para tahanan yang tubuhnya kemudian dibuang ke dalam lubang. Menilai dari foto atau lukisan berjudul ‘Death by Skewering’, para tahanan hukuman mati diberikan kebebasan tearkhir untuk memilih metode eksekusi mereka, ditusuk atau dijerat. James melompat masuk ke dalam salah satu lubang disana dan mendapati diri berada di area kafetaria, tempat ia bertemu dengan Eddie Dombrowski yang sedang menggenggam sebuah revolver dan tampaknya sangat menikmati pembunuhan yang ia lakukan... Saat ditanyakan mengenai tubuh seorang pria yang tergeletak mati di atas meja, Eddie awalnya mengaku sang pria tiba-tiba datang menyerang, sehingga ia harus membela diri dengan menembakkan senjatanya. Namun ceritanya berubah ketika James berusaha mengulik apa yang sebenarnya terjadi. Eddie memberitahu bahwa sang pria diam-diam mengikutinya dari belakang, dan saat ia menoleh ke arahnya, ia kesal dengan cara sang pria menatap dirinya, sehingga ia membunuhnya. Eddie berusaha meyakinkan James bahwa ia melakukan perbuatan yang benar, mengklaim sang pria terus menatap dan mengolok-olok dirinya terlepas dari permintaannya untuk berhenti. Namun James merasa itu bukanlah perbuatan yang benar, mengajarkan pada Eddie bahwa ia tidak seharusnya membunuh seseorang hanya karena cara mereka menatap. Eddie, sambil mengarahkan revolver pada James, terdiam sejenak, sebelum kemudian mulai tertawa, beralasan ia hanya bercanda. Tubuh pria di atas meja sudah ada sejak ia datang kesini. Ditinggal sendiri, James mulai menelusuri Toluca Prison, dimana setelah sempat dikeroyok oleh para monster yang bermunculan dari segala arah dan memperoleh senapan, ia dipaksa untuk memilih satu di antara keenam tiang gantung yang diletakkan di ruang eksekusi. Cara memilih tiang gantung yang benar adalah dengan menyusun keenam puisi di papan mural dengan tepat dan memahaminya. Keenam puisi ini masing-masing bercerita tentang kejahatan yang dilakukan oleh 6 tahanan di Toluca Prison, dimulai dari pembakaran, pencurian, penculikan, perusakan, pembunuhan, dan penghilangan nyawa terhadap ibu sendiri. Kita harus memahami skenario di setiap puisi dan memasangkannya dengan pengakuan setiap tahanan. Setelah itu, pilih satu di antara mereka yang dibenarkan melakukan tindak kejahatan. Jika kita salah memilih, maka James akan dijatuhkan ke ruang bawah tanah penuh monster dan bisa naik kembali melalui tangga disana. Jika kita memillih tiang gantung yang benar, maka James akan dijatuhkan ke area bawah tanah, tempat ia harus menelusuri area yang lebih dalam lagi dengan melompat ke dalam lubang sebanyak 2 kali dan menggunakan elevator yang anehnya malah berakhir di sebuah rumah. James mengikuti arah suara Angela yang terdengar seperti sedang berbicara dengan ayahnya dan menemukannya di sebuah ruangan dalam kondisi ketakutan, memohon-mohon untuk tidak disakiti dan berjanji akan menjadi anak yang baik. Ketika hendak menyadarkannya, sesosok monster bernama Abstract Daddy tiba-tiba datang menyerang, tidak memberikan James pilihan lain selain mencari cara untuk mengalahkan sang monster di lorong yang berliku-liku. Di tengah upayanya ini, ia mempelajari sedikit mengenai trauma masa lalu Angela. Ayah Angela, bernama Thomas Orosco adalah seorang penebang kayu alkoholik yang kerap melakukan perbuatan tidak pantas pada anaknya sendiri saat mabuk, secara tidak langsung mengembangkan perasaan benci dalam diri Angela terhadap laki-laki. Selain itu, saudaranya juga tidak ada bedanya dengan ayahnya, dan ibunya tidak ingin ikut campur, mengatakan Angela layak mendapatkan perlakuan seperti itu. Seluruh perlakuan ini membuat kondisi kesehatan mentalnya hancur, sehingga di suatu malam, atas amarah yang telah ia dendam selama bertahun-tahun, Angela mengambil pisau dapur dan menghabisi nyawa sang ayah sebelum melarikan diri dari rumah. Untuk itu kini setelah James berhasil menumbangkan Abstract Daddy yang merupakan perwujudan dari ayah Angela, Angela langsung meluapkan kemarahannya dengan menendang-nendang tubuh sang monster dan melemparinya tv. James berusaha menenangkannya, namun Angela malah membentak dan menganggap James sama seperti semua laki-laki, hanya menginginkan satu hal... Saat mendengar pengakuan James tentang bagaimana ia tidak berniat menyakiti dan hanya ingin mencari istrinya, Mary, Angela menuduh bahwa James sebenarnya tidak menginginkan istrinya lagi dan mungkin telah menemukan wanita lain, yang dimana tuduhan ini membuat James marah dan Angela pergi meninggalkannya... Berjalan lebih jauh, James mencapai sebuah area menyerupai labirin dengan keberadaan ratusan tangan monster yang menghalangi jalan utama, disebut Strange Door, memaksanya untuk menempuh jalur lain yang malah secara mengejutkan mempertemukannya kembali pada Maria di balik jeruji. Kondisi Maria yang tampak baik-baik saja mengejutkan James yang jelas-jelas melihat Maria terbunuh oleh Pyramid Head tepat di hadapannya, namun disini Maria bertingkah seolah semua itu tidak terjadi, mengklaim terakhir kali bertemu, mereka berdua terpisah di basement rumah sakit. Mungkin James hanya salah orang, pikirnya, karena James memang sering lupa, sama seperti di saat mereka berdua menginap di sebuah hotel dan James lupa membawa pulang videotape yang mereka buat. Maria penasaran apakah videotape itu masih ada di hotel. Mendengar ini, James semakin dibuat bingung, bagaimana bisa Maria tahu soal kejadian itu, kejadian yang seharusnya hanya diketahui oleh Mary dan dirinya. James berusaha memastikan bahwa orang yang ada di hadapannya saat ini adalah Maria dan bukan Mary, namun Maria tidak memberikan jawaban yang jelas, mengatakan tidak peduli siapa dirinya, ia ada disini hanya untuk James. Sadar tidak akan mendapatkan kejelasan, James pergi meninggalkan Maria dan berjanji akan kembali untuk membebaskannya. Melalui 3 area penuh teror dan teka-teki, James sempat berhadapan dengan Pyramid Head dan mempelajari bahwa senjata Pyramid Head bernama Great Knife dapat menghalau ratusan tangan monster yang menghalangi jalan. Namun saat membuka pintu ruang 208 yang mengarahkannya ke sisi lain jeruji, ia mendapati tubuh Maria tergeletak mati dengan bekas luka di sekujur tubuh dan setengah wajahnya. James entah mengapa merasakan perasaan sedih yang teramat dalam, namun ia kemudian teringat dengan perkataan Maria tentang sebuah hotel tempat ia dan Mary dulu menginap. Berpikir mungkin itu adalah tempat spesial yang dimaksud di surat Mary, James beranjak pergi kesana. Dengan memanfaatkan Great Knife yang tertancap di area tengah, James berhasil membuka Strange Door dan mencapai area pemakaman, tempat ia menemukan batu nisan milik Miriam K. yang dianggap sebagai pengkhianat, Angela Orosco, Eddie Dombrowski, Walter Sullivan yang adalah seorang pembunuh berantai, nantinya akan menjadi antagonis utama di Silent Hill 4, dan batu nisan yang hanya mendeksripsikan orang di dalamnya sebagai orang jahat yang menginginkan sebotol bir sebelum dieksekusi, para fans percaya orang yang dimaksud adalah Thomas Orosco, ayah Angela. Namun satu-satunya makam yang berlubang adalah makam milik James Sunderland, dan saat ia melompat masuk ke dalamnya, ia dipindahkan kembali ke realita dan berjalan melewati lorong berdarah yang mengarah ke ruang pendingin, tempat ia sekali lagi bertemu dengan Eddie yang tampak sedang berbicara dengan mayat seorang pria. Eddie menuduh sang pria telah mengikutinya tanpa henti dan dengan kesal bertanya, berapa kali lagi ia harus membunuhnya. Tidak seperti pertemuan sebelumnya, kini saat Eddie menyadari keberadaan James, ia langsung mengungkapkan apa yang sebenarnya terjadi secara terang-terangan, dimana menurutnya pria yang tergeletak mati disana telah mengikutinya kemanapun ia pergi dan membully-nya habis-habisan, mengejeknya gendut, menjijikkan, dan bahkan memintanya untuk mengakhiri hidup. Seluruh hinaan itu menyadarkannya bahwa semua orang, tidak peduli mereka pintar, bodoh, jelek, atau cantik, pada akhirnya akan berakhir sama saat mereka sudah mati. Buktinya, sang pembully sudah tidak bisa tertawa lagi sekalinya ia mati... James berusaha menenangkan Eddie, namun Eddie menyuruhnya menutup mulut dan menuduh James telah diam-diam menertawakan dirinya di belakang sejak mereka pertama kali bertemu. Merasa terancam, James melontarkan tinju dan menyarankan Eddie untuk mencari pertolongan, yang dimana saran ini tidak diterima oleh Eddie dengan baik, melainkan ia malah menganggap James sebagai orang yang munafik, karena ia tahu James datang kesini juga setelah mendapatkan panggilan dari kota Silent Hill. Sebelum pergi, Eddie memberitahu bahwa James tidak jauh berbeda darinya dan akan segera memahami apa yang ia maksud... Memeriksa sekitar, kita akan menyadari keberadaan beberapa mayat yang memiliki wajah sama persis satu sama lain. James menyusul Eddie ke ruang penyimpanan daging dan mendengar pengakuannya tentang apa yang ia alami di masa lalu. Selama bertahun-tahun lamanya, Eddie telah menjadi sasaran bully yang empuk oleh teman sekolahnya karena kelebihan berat badan, namun yang paling parah adalah seorang pemain sepak bola di SMA yang masih membully-nya bahkan setelah mereka sudah lulus. Untuk itu atas kemarahannya, Eddie membalas dengan membunuh anjing peliharaannya, dan saat si pembully datang menghampiri, ia langsung menembak kakinya menggunakan senjata milik ayahnya, melumpuhkan si pembully. Eddie memang tidak membunuhnya, tapi ia sudah cukup puas mendengar jeritan kesakitan si pembully. Setelah menceritakan masa lalunya itu, Eddie mengamuk dan mengatakan sekarang adalah giliran James. Situasi ini memaksa James untuk menggunakan daging sebagai perlindungan dari tembakan Eddie dan mengambil celah untuk menyerang balik. Beberapa kali terkena tembakan, Eddie akhirnya berhasil ditumbangkan, membuat James merasa bersalah atas pembunuhan yang ia lakukan pada manusia. Kini tanpa halangan dari seorang pun, James mencapai pelabuhan di dekat Toluca Lake dan menggunakan perahu disana untuk mendayung melintasi danau menuju Lakeview Hotel, hotel tempat ia dan Mary tinggal selama berlibur di kota Silent Hill. Setibanya disana, James menyadari bahwa tempat ini tidak berubah sedikit pun sejak 3 tahun yang lalu, dan satu hal yang membuatnya semakin yakin bahwa Mary sedang menunggunya di dalam adalah sebuah tulisan yang tertera di peta, dimana menurut tulisan itu, Mary sedang menunggunya di ruang kamar 312, ruang kamar mereka berdua di Lakeview Hotel. Di tengah penelusurannya, James dikejutkan oleh Laura yang membunyikan piano di area restoran, namun tidak seperti pertemuan mereka sebelumnya, kali ini Laura mengaku James tidak seburuk yang ia kira dan meminta bantuannya untuk mencari Mary yang ia yakini berada di sekitar sini, paling tidak itu yang tertulis di surat Mary. James sedikit terkejut mengetahui bahwa Laura tidak berbohong soal surat peninggalan Mary, dan Laura memang membenarkannya, mengklaim ia mencurinya dari dalam loker perawat Rachel, pengasuh yang ditugaskan untuk merawat Mary dan Laura di rumah sakit. Laura kemudian mempersilakan James membacanya. Surat itu dititipkan oleh Mary pada perawat Rachel untuk diberikan pada Laura saat ia sudah pergi. Mary memberitahu bahwa ia sudah berada di tempat yang jauh, tempat yang sangat indah dan tenang. Ia meminta maaf karena tidak sempat mengucapkan selamat tinggal dan meminta Laura untuk berperilaku baik dengan para suster di rumah sakit. Perihal James, ia tahu Laura membencinya karena berpikir James tidak memperlakukan Mary dengan baik, tapi Mary meminta Laura untuk memberikan James kesempatan kedua. Memang James terkadang bisa menjadi kasar dan jarang tertawa, tapi sebenarnya dia adalah orang yang sangat manis. Di penghujung surat, Mary mengungkapkan betapa ia sangat menyayangi Laura seperti anaknya sendiri dan mengucapkan selamat ulang tahun yang ke-8... Untuk memastikan, James menanyakan usia Laura, dan Laura yang sedang sibuk menggambar di kaca jendela menjawab bahwa ia baru saja menginjak usia 8 tahun satu minggu yang lalu. Artinya, Mary tidak mungkin meninggal 3 tahun yang lalu. James mulai meragukan apa yang ia yakini selama ini dan semakin yakin Mary benar-benar menunggunya disini. Laura, di sisi lain, yakin ini adalah tempat tenang yang dimaksud oleh Mary, karena selama berada di rumah sakit, Mary sering bercerita tentang kota Silent Hill dan mengungkapkan keinginannya untuk kembali ke kota itu. Di tengah perbincangan, Laura tiba-tiba teringat dengan surat yang ditinggalkan oleh Mary kepada James. Laura mengaku sempat ingin membukanya, berpikir James tidak layak mendapatkan surat itu, tapi ia kemudian teringat dengan Mary yang tidak mungkin senang jika ia melakukannya, sehingga ia memutuskan untuk menyimpannya baik-baik dan berniat memberikannya pada James di waktu yang tepat. Ini adalah waktunya, namun saat James membuka amplop, ia tidak menemukan apa-apa di dalamnya. Laura bersumpah tidak mengambilnya dan bergegas pergi mencari karena ia pikir ia pasti tidak sengaja menjatuhkannya di suatu tempat. Sementara itu, James menemukan catatan di meja resepsionis yang ditujukan padanya, berisi pemberitahuan tentang videotape yang tidak sengaja ia tinggalkan di ruang kamar hotel yang kini telah dipindahkan ke Employee Section. Namun karena satu-satunya cara untuk mencapai Employee Section adalah dengan melalui elevator khusus karyawan yang tidak mampu menopang beban terlalu berat, James terpaksa harus meletakkan seluruh barangnya sebelum turun ke Employee Section. Sialnya sembari ia harus mencari password untuk membuka berankas tempat videotape disimpan, ia juga harus menghindari monster Mandarin yang mengawasi area itu. Berhasil memperoleh videotape, James bergegas keluar dari Employee Section, mengambil kembali peralatannya, dan mencapai ruang kamar 312, tempat ia menemukan videotape player dan menggunakannya untuk memutar videotape yang baru saja ia peroleh, menunjukkan momen bahagia terakhir James dan Mary di Lakeview Hotel... Momen bahagia ini seketika digantikan dengan adegan dimana James membunuh Mary yang sedang berbaring di atas ranjang dengan membekapnya menggunakan bantal... James terduduk diam, menyadari kebenaran yang terjadi dan berusaha menghadapi rasa bersalah dalam dirinya. Tak lama kemudian, Laura datang untuk menanyakan apakah James sudah bertemu dengan Mary, namun disini James memutuskan untuk menyampaikan kebenarannya, bahwa Mary sudah mati dan ialah yang membunuhnya. Seketika mendengar ini, Laura yang patah hati langsung menjadi marah besar dan pergi meninggalkannya... James terduduk disana selama beberapa saat, paling tidak sebelum ia mendengar suara Mary dari dalam radio yang mendesaknya untuk menemukan dirinya dan memintanya untuk tidak menyerah, mengklaim James sudah dekat.... James sekali lagi dipindahkan ke Otherworld, dimana di tengah penelusurannya ini, ia mendengar rekaman suara dokter yang menangani Mary di rumah sakit. Sang dokter menjelaskan bahwa kondisi Mary sudah tidak bisa disembuhkan dan ia akan terus menderita sepanjang sisa waktunya. Di area basement, James bertemu kembali dengan Angela, kali ini terlihat sedang berdiri diam di tengah-tengah tangga yang terbakar. Awalnya, Angela mengira James sebagai ibunya, mengatakan sang ibu akan menjadi orang terakhir yang ia temui sebelum ia bisa beristirahat dengan tenang. Namun saat menyadari bahwa ternyata orang yang ada di hadapannya adalah James, ia menjadi putus asa. Angela berterima kasih pada James karena telah menyelamatkannya sebelumnya, tapi ia harap James tidak melakukan itu, karena bahkan ibunya saja mengatakan ia layak menerima apa yang terjadi. Setelah meminta James untuk tidak mengasihaninya, Angela menginginkan kembali pisau miliknya, tapi karena James menolak, ia pun pergi dari sana, mengatakan itu tidak akan mengubah apapun. Angela kemudian sedikit terkejut ketika mendengar bagaimana James juga merasakan hawa panas di sekitar, hidupnya sudah selalu seperti ini, katanya. Sadar situasi Angela sudah tidak tertolong, James pergi mencapai area lobi, tempat ia sekali lagi mendapati Maria dalam keadaan hidup dan dieksekusi oleh 2 Pyramid Head. Di titik ini, James akhirnya sadar bahwa Pyramid Head diciptakan olehnya sebagai bentuk hukuman atas pembunuhan yang ia lakukan pada Mary, sehingga setelah berhasil membuktikan bahwa ia tidak lagi membutuhkan mereka, kedua Pyramid Head menghabisi nyawa mereka sendiri tepat di hadapan James, meninggalkan 2 butir telur, telur berwarna merah cerah dan telur berwarna kusam. Menggunakan salah satu telur untuk membuka gerbang, James dituntun ke sebuah lorong dan diingatkan kembali pada pertemuannya dengan Mary. Ada saat dimana James menjenguk Mary di rumah sakit sambil membawakan bunga, namun Mary malah menolaknya mentah-mentah dan mengusir James pergi dari sana. Ia menganggap dirinya menjijikkan seperti monster, tidak berguna, dan sudah pasrah akan kenyataan bahwa ia tak lama lagi akan meninggalkan dunia ini. Bahkan ia sempat mengatakan akan lebih mudah jika mereka langsung membunuhnya, tapi ia tahu rumah sakit mendapatkan keuntungan dari pasien seperti dirinya. Melihat James masih juga belum pulang, Mary menjadi marah besar, memintanya untuk pergi dan jangan kembali lagi. Namun di saat-saat akhir, ia tiba-tiba berubah pikiran dan meminta James untuk jangan meninggalkannya sendirian, mengklaim ia tidak bermaksud mengatakan semua itu. Disinilah game Silent Hill 2 Remake akan diakhiri dengan 3 ending utama tergantung dengan keputusan kita di sepanjang permainan. Perlu diketahui, Silent Hill 2 Remake menggunakan sistem reputasi atau poin dalam perolehan ending, jadi kalian tidak perlu melakukan semua persyaratan yang nantinya kami sampaikan, hanya saja persyaratan itu akan membantu kalian mendapatkan poin yang diperlukan untuk memperoleh ending tertentu. Untuk mendapatkan Leave Ending, kita harus memberikan perhatian yang lebih pada Mary daripada Maria. Artinya di sepanjang game berlangsung, jangan habiskan waktu terlalu banyak dengan Maria, jangan memeriksa kondisinya di rumah sakit saat ia tiba-tiba jatuh sakit, dan jangan menunjukkan ketertarikan untuk membantunya ketika monster menyerang. Kita juga harus memastikan James selalu berada dalam keadaan baik, jadi sebisa mungkin segera mengonsumsi healing item saat terkena serangan musuh. Sementara itu, cara untuk memberikan perhatian lebih pada Mary adalah dengan sering-sering memeriksa foto dan surat Mary yang ada di inventory, ada yang bilang minimal 3 kali, dan jangan membaca pesan ancaman yang tertulis di atas jukebox di Neely’s Bar. Di area taman Lakeview Hotel, ambil buah apel busuk dan gunakan buah itu di puzzle cermin di ruang 202. Dan setelah berhadapan dengan 2 Pyramid Head di area lobi, gunakan telur berwarna kusam untuk membuka gerbang. Terakhir, dengarkan keluhan Mary di lorong sampai habis. James mencapai atap hotel dan bertemu dengan Mary yang langsung dipeluknya sambil melepas rindu. Namun ia segera menyadari bahwa orang yang ada di hadapannya ini bukanlah Mary, melainkan Maria yang sedang berpura-pura menjadi istrinya. Maria, di sisi lain, berusaha meyakinkan James untuk menerimanya, mengatakan ia bisa menjadi versi Mary yang lebih baik, sosok istri yang sedari dulu diinginkan oleh James, hanya untuk kemudian dikecewakan oleh James yang menegaskan bahwa tidak ada seorang pun yang bisa menggantikan istrinya dan semua kepura-puraan ini harus segera dihentikan. Jawaban James membuat Maria marah, sehingga atas bentuk penolakannya dalam melepaskan James, ia pun berubah menjadi monster yang menyerupai Flesh Lip. Tubuhnya terperangkap di dalam rangka logam dalam posisi terbalik dan kerap berteriak, merujuk pada rasa sakit dan penderitaan Mary. Berhasil menakhlukkannya, James diberi kesempatan untuk bertemu kembali dengan Mary yang terbaring lemah di atas ranjang, dimana dalam pertemuan ini, James mengakui bahwa ia menghabisi nyawa Mary bukan atas rasa kasihan melihat istrinya menderita secara terus menerus, bukan juga karena Mary pernah meminta seseorang untuk mengakhiri penderitaannya, melainkan karena ia sangat membenci Mary yang telah merenggut seluruh kehidupannya. Sejak Mary sakit-sakitan, James tidak lagi memiliki kehidupan normal. James kini menyesali perbuatannya itu, namun terlepas dari apapun alasannya, Mary tetap memaafkan. Mary kemudian memberikan sebuah surat, mengatakan itu adalah surat yang dicari-cari oleh James selama ini. Setelah pertemuannya dengan Mary, James pergi menemui Laura dan memberikan surat tersebut, sebelum kemudian mereka berdua memutuskan untuk pergi meninggalkan kota Silent Hill bersama-sama... Untuk mendapatkan In Water Ending, kita harus memastikan James tidak dalam keadaan baik-baik saja di sepanjang permainan. Artinya jika terkena serangan musuh, jangan langsung menggunakan healing item, terutama syringe yang malah akan menyembuhkan kondisi James secara menyeluruh. Selain itu, kita juga harus membunuh lebih dari 350 musuh, membaca pesan ancaman di atas jukebox, membuka gerbang menggunakan telur yang kusam, dan dengarkan keluhan Mary di lorong sampai habis. Cutscene akan berjalan sama persis dengan Leave Ending, dimana James bertemu dengan Maria yang berpura-pura menjadi Mary di atap hotel dan terlibat dalam pertarungan dengannya. Setelah berhasil menakhlukkan Maria, James kembali ke mobilnya dan mengungkapkan bahwa ia tidak bisa memaafkan dirinya atas apa yang telah ia lakukan. Ia tahu Mary ingin ia tetap hidup, tapi ia tidak lagi memiliki keinginan untuk melanjutkan hidup tanpa keberadaan Mary. Untuk itu sambil membawa jasad Mary di bangku belakang, James mengemudikan mobilnya menabrak pembatas jalan hingga menyebur ke Toluca Lake, membunuhnya dalam proses. Bersamaan dengan itu, surat Mary tenggelam... Berketerbalikan dengan Leave Ending, untuk mendapatkan Maria Ending, kita harus memberikan perhatian lebih pada Maria, seperti menanggapi Maria di ruang 108 motel Jacks Inn saat ia menunjukkan sebuah pakaian, memastikan Maria baik-baik saja saat ia ketakutan melihat Baldwin Mansion, memeriksa kondisi Maria di rumah sakit, gunakan buah apel yang matang di puzzle cermin, bantu Maria saat diserang oleh monster, membuka gerbang menggunakan telur berwarna merah cerah, dan jangan dengarkan keluhan Mary di lorong sampai habis. Beberapa hal yang harus dihindari adalah melihat foto dan surat Mary di inventory, membiarkan Maria terkena serangan musuh, berjauhan dengan Maria, dan terlalu sering menabraknya. Dengan begitu, saat James mencapai atap hotel, ia mendapati Mary sedang terduduk di atas ranjang. Namun saat ia melepas rindu, Mary menyampaikan bahwa ia sudah tahu James sebenarnya tidak pernah peduli padanya, terbukti dari bagaimana James tega membunuhnya saat ia sedang dalam kondisi lemah. James beralasan ia melakukan itu karena tidak tega melihat penderitaan yang dialami oleh Mary, hanya untuk sekali lagi ditepis oleh Mary yang telah mengetahui kenyataan bahwa James sangat membenci dirinya. Tersudut, James akhirnya mengakui perasaan bencinya terhadap Mary, mengatakan ia tidak tahan harus menjalani kehidupan yang seperti itu selama 3 tahun lamanya. Mary dapat memahami alasan James. Ia memang tidak bisa memberikan kebahagiaan, tapi ia kemudian bertanya, apakah Maria bisa memberikan itu? Sebelum James bisa menjawab, Mary menjadi marah besar dan mengatakan bahwa ia tidak bisa memaafkan perbuatan James, seketika mengubahnya menjadi monster. James terpaksa membunuhnya, dan setelah semuanya sudah berakhir, ia pergi mengunjungi klub Heaven’s Night untuk menemui Maria yang entah bagaimana bangkit kembali. Maria memberikan surat Mary, dan bersama-sama, mereka berdua kembali ke mobil. Namun di area parkiran, Maria mulai batuk, menyiratkan bahwa ia juga menderita penyakit sama yang diderita oleh Mary. James memintanya untuk segera mengatasi batuk itu... Berikutnya ada 5 ending yang hanya bisa diperoleh dalam mode New Game+ Untuk mendapatkan Rebirth Ending, kita harus memperoleh 4 item khusus, seperti buku Crimson Ceremony yang bisa ditemukan di area pemakaman, buku Lost Memories di ruang Lost & Found di Lakeview Hotel, dan 2 benda suci yang digunakan oleh sekte religius bernama the Order untuk keperluan ritual, yaitu sebotol White Chrysm di atas meja di depan Baldwin Mansion dan piala obsidian di museum Historical Society. Setelah memperoleh keempat benda tersebut, selesaikan game seperti biasa, maka di saat James mencapai atap hotel, ia akan bertemu dengan Maria yang berpura-pura menjadi Mary. James segera mengetahui penyamarannya dan memberitahu bahwa Maria tidak akan bisa menggantikan Mary. Dan terlepas dari upaya Maria dalam meyakinkan James untuk menerimanya, James menolak. Sebaliknya, ia justru menyampaikan rencana untuk membangkitkan Mary, tapi agar ritual dapat berjalan dengan baik, ia harus memutus ikatan emosional yang tersisa dengan Maria, atau dengan kata lain, ia harus membunuh Maria. Mendengar ini, Maria menjadi marah besar dan berubah menjadi monster, hanya untuk akhirnya ditakhlukkan oleh James. James kemudian membawa serta mayat Mary di atas perahu menuju Church of Rebirth, gereja yang kemungkinan digunakan oleh sekte The Order untuk menjalankan ritual. Disana, James berencana untuk menjalankan ritual kelahiran dengan tujuan membangkitkan Mary, percaya ada kehadiran Dewa Kuno yang masih belum meninggalkan kota Silent Hill, dewa yang akan memberikan kekuatan pada siapapun yang memuja mereka... Stillness Ending adalah ending yang baru ditambahkan di versi remake, dan untuk mendapatkannya, kita harus membuka In Water Ending terlebih dahulu. Lalu setelah itu, di mode New Game+, kita harus mengambil gergaji di awal permainan dan menggunakannya untuk menghancurkan kaca mobil hijau di dekat persimpangan Wiltse Road dan Nathan Avenue. Di dalamnya, kita akan memperoleh Key of Sorrow yang nantinya digunakan untuk membuka sebuah berankas di kantor manajer di versi Otherworld dari Lakeview Hotel. Kode untuk membukanya adalah 314 dengan urutan kanan kiri kanan. Kita akan memperoleh kartu pos Toluca Lake dari dalam berankas, dan terakhir, selesaikan game seperti biasa. Mirip dengan In Water Ending, setelah berhasil menakhlukkan monster Maria, James kembali ke mobil dan mengungkapkan perasaan bersalahnya atas pembunuhan yang ia lakukan pada Mary. Ia tidak lagi memiliki keinginan untuk melanjutkan hidup, tapi sebelum memutuskan untuk mengakhiri hidup di Toluca Lake, ia membayangkan kehadiran Mary yang membuatnya semakin tenggelam dalam perasaan bersalah. Ia bahkan tidak sanggup membaca surat peninggalan Mary... Untuk mendapatkan ending ini, kita harus pergi ke arena bowling bernama Pete’s Bowl-O-Rama dan membuka berankas di belakang meja kasir dengan kode 1887. Dari dalam sana, kita akan memperoleh Rusted Key yang nantinya dapat digunakan untuk membuka peti kecil yang bisa ditemukan di sebuah gazebo di area taman Brookhaven Hospital, berisi sebotol obat White Claudia. White Claudia sendiri adalah tanaman yang tumbuh di dekat sumber air di kota Silent Hill dan bijinya mengandung sifat halusinogen yang telah digunakan dalam upacara keagamaan oleh sekte the Order sejak zaman dulu. Sebelum menyaksikan videotape di ruang kamar 312 Lakeview Hotel, minum White Claudia terlebih dahulu. Dengan begitu, game akan langsung diakhiri dengan Bliss Ending. James terduduk di depan tv dan menyaksikan videotape yang menunjukkan momen bahagia terakhirnya dengan Mary, namun kali ini, videotape tidak terpotong, melainkan menunjukkan kelanjutan yang bahagia, dimana James berjanji akan membawa Mary kembali ke kota Silent Hill lagi suatu saat nanti. Raut wajah James sempat dipenuhi dengan kekhawatiran, namun saat Mary menanyakannya, ia mengatakan semuanya baik-baik saja. Aneh, James sudah tidak ada di ruangan itu. Hal ini menyiratkan bahwa kelanjutan videotape itu tidak benar-benar terjadi, melainkan hanya merupakan bagian dalam halusinasi James, mengingat ia mengonsumsi White Claudia sebelum menyaksikan videotape. Untuk mendapatkan Dog Ending, ending yang paling terkenal dalam game Silent Hill 2, kita harus memperoleh 2 bagian kunci yang rusak. Bagian pertama bisa ditemukan di toko hewan, sedangkan bagian kedua bisa ditemukan di Katz Street, lebih tepatnya di rumah anjing di halaman belakang sebuah rumah yang gerbangnya bermotif jejak kaki anjing. Satukan kedua bagian kunci dan gunakan kunci itu untuk membuka ruang Observasi di Lakeview Hotel, maka game akan langsung diakhiri dengan Dog Ending. Di dalam sana, sebuah twist terbesar sepanjang sejarah terungkap. Rupanya seluruh teror mengerikan yang terjadi di sepanjang game dikendalikan oleh seekor anjing. Tidak seperti versi originalnya yang dimana James tiba-tiba berbicara dalam bahasa Jepang, di versi remakenya, James berbicara dalam bahasa Polandia. Alasan di baliknya adalah karena versi remake dari Silent Hill 2 digarap oleh developer asal Polandia, yaitu Bloober Team... Terakhir, untuk mendapatkan UFO Ending, kita harus mengambil permata biru di toko perhiasan dan menggunakan permata itu di 4 lokasi, yaitu di atap Saul Street Apartment, ujung dermaga Rosewater Park, dermaga Lakeview Hotel, dan di ruang 312 Lakeview Hotel sebelum menyaksikan videotape. Game akan langsung diakhiri dengan UFO Ending, dimana permata yang digunakan James di 4 lokasi berbeda ternyata memanggil keberadaan UFO yang kemudian menurunkan versi original dari James Sunderland. Itu adalah alien yang menyamar menjadi James original, disebut Space James, yang diturunkan dengan tujuan untuk menggantikan posisi James, sehingga setelah Space James meyakinkan James bahwa dialah yang asli dari antara mereka berdua, para alien menculik James dan membiarkan Space James menjelajahi kota Silent Hill untuk mencari Mary... Di versi originalnya, James bertemu dengan Harry Mason, protagonis utama dalam game Silent Hill 1, yang sedang mencari putrinya. Itu dia kedelapan ending yang bisa didapatkan dalam game Silent Hill 2 Remake. Untuk memperjelas kisahnya, mari kita masuk ke dalam babak penjelasan. Pertama-tama, kita harus memahami apa itu kota Silent Hill dan bagaimana cara kerjanya. Sebenarnya penjelasan ini sudah pernah kami berikan di plot Silent Hill series, tapi disini kami akan membahasnya lagi secara singkat. Silent Hill adalah sebuah kota misterius yang terletak di Maine, Amerika Serikat, dan telah memiliki sejarah yang panjang di masa lalu, dimana sebelum masa penjajahan Inggris di Amerika terjadi, atau lebih tepatnya sebelum abad ke-17, wilayah Silent Hill yang pada saat itu masih belum bernama “Silent Hill” diduduki oleh warga suku asli Amerika yang menyebut danau Toluca sebagai “The Place of the Silent Spirits” atau “tempat tinggal roh-roh diam”. Yang mereka maksud dengan ‘roh’ bukan hanya mengacu pada kerabat mereka yang sudah meninggal, tapi juga roh-roh yang mereka percayai mendiami pohon, batu, dan air di sekitar sana. Nah karena The Place of the Silent Spirits sudah lama dipercaya memiliki semacam kekuatan spiritual dan aura misterius, mereka menganggap wilayah di sekitarnya sebagai tanah suci dan melakukan berbagai ritual dan upacara sesuai dengan kepercayaan masyarakat adat. Bahkan ada suku tertentu yang menyembah dewa bernama Kwekwaxawe. Namun pada abad ke-17, dengan didirikannya Koloni Inggris permanen pertama di Jamestown, hanya masalah waktu saja sebelum para penjajah menyerbu The Place of The Silent Spirits, memaksa para penduduk asli meninggalkan tanah suci mereka. Para pemukim memutuskan untuk tetap tinggal di wilayah itu dan mulai membangun pemukiman yang nantinya berkembang menjadi kota ‘Silent Hill’. Tapi 1 abad kemudian, pada sekitar awal tahun 1700-an, sebuah epidemi melanda wilayah di sekitar Danau Toluca dan menyebabkan sebagian besar penduduknya meninggal. Wilayah Silent Hill pada akhirnya ditinggalkan terbengkalai, paling tidak sebelum dihuni kembali pada abad ke-19, dimana di masa-masa inilah, pembangunan gedung rumah sakit Brookhaven Hospital dan penjara Toluca Prison mulai berjalan, begitu pula dengan penemuan area tambang Wiltse Coal Mine. Ini bukan berarti para warga bisa mulai hidup dengan nyaman, karena justru banyak sekali insiden misterius yang terjadi dari waktu ke waktu, terlebih setelah sekte bernama The Order menempati kota Silent Hill pada sekitar abad ke-20 dan melakukan berbagai upacara ritual. Sekte The Order adalah kelompok religius yang menjadi antagonis utama dalam seri Silent Hill garapan Team Silent, kecuali Silent Hill 2. Itulah kenapa di sepanjang permainan, kita tidak pernah melihat adanya keterlibatan The Order, melainkan game ini lebih berfokus pada cerita James Sunderland. Sedangkan kalau kalian memainkan game Silent Hill 1,3, dan 4, kalian bisa melihat keterlibatan the Order secara langsung, termasuk ritual mengerikan yang mereka lakukan. Silent Hill 5 Homecoming, meski bukan digarap oleh Team Silent, juga masih melibatkan the Order. Meski tidak memiliki keterlibatan secara langsung dengan seri keduanya, The Order memiliki peran yang cukup signifikan dalam pengembangan Backstory Silent Hill, dimana dipercaya bahwa berbagai ritual yang mereka lakukan di kota Silent Hill di masa lalu, telah memperburuk kutukan yang diletakkan oleh para penduduk asli Amerika sebelum mereka pergi meninggalkan wilayah itu. Pada sekitar awal tahun 1900-an, Toluca Prison ditutup tanpa alasan yang jelas dan digantikan dengan gedung museum Historical Society. Lalu karena area pertambangan Wiltse Coal Mine juga ditutup hanya sesaat setelah itu, mereka pun memutuskan untuk mengubah kota Silent Hill menjadi kota wisata demi mendapatkan sumber pendapatan baru. Namun sebagai akibat dari aktivitas okultisme The Order yang malah memperburuk kutukan, serangkaian insiden misterius mulai terjadi, dimulai dari kapal wisata Little Baroness yang menghilang secara misterius di Danau Toluca pada tahun 1918, serangkaian kematian yang terjadi secara berturut-turut, kematian anggota staf yang mempromosikan Silent Hill sebagai kota wisata, dan lain sebagainya. Seluruh insiden ini tentu menakuti para warga yang tinggal disana, sehingga mereka memutuskan untuk meninggalkan kota Silent Hill, membiarkannya terbengkalai selayaknya kota mati. Pada satu titik, Kota Silent Hill tiba-tiba diselimuti oleh kabut tebal misterius. Fenomena supernatural dimana kabut tebal menyelimuti kota Silent Hill, disebut sebagai fenomana ‘Fog World’, adalah elemen utama yang berperan besar dalam pengembangan cerita game Silent Hill 2. Diketahui bahwa fenomena ini dapat mempengaruhi kondisi psikis seseorang sampai-sampai mereka akan kesulitan membedakan antara mimpi dan realita. Apapun yang tersembunyi di alam bawah sadar seseorang dapat termanifestasi atau terwujud di dunia nyata, termasuk monster, orang terdekat, lingkungan sekitar, dan hal-hal sekecil apapun itu. Namun yang lebih berbahaya lagi adalah adalah Fenomena Fog World secara berkala akan bergeser ke bagian yang lebih dalam dari mimpi buruk seseorang, dan jika sudah terpicu, maka sang korban akan dipindahkan ke dunia alternatif yang jauh lebih gelap dan mengerikan, disebut sebagai “Otherworld”. Biasanya orang-orang yang bermasalah, dalam artian memiliki trauma masa lalu, akan lebih rentan terkena fenomena Fog World, tapi bukan mereka yang mau masuk ke kota Silent Hill untuk mengalami semua itu, melainkan kota Silent Hill lah yang secara misterius memanggil mereka. Ini yang terjadi pada protagonis utama kita, James Sunderland. James pertama kali bertemu dengan Mary saat ia menghadiri pesta yang diadakan oleh temannya di rumah, dimana dari pertemuan itu, mereka mulai menjalin hubungan. Pada satu titik setelah menikah, atau lebih tepatnya sekitar 3 tahun sebelum kejadian utama di Silent Hill 2, James dan Mary memutuskan untuk berlibur ke kota Silent Hill. Mereka menginap di Lakeview Hotel di kamar nomor 312 dan James sering merekam Mary, salah satunya adalah videotape yang menunjukkan bagaimana Mary berbicara tentang kota Silent Hill yang dulunya dianggap sebagai tempat suci. Mary sangat menikmati waktunya disana, sehingga ia mengungkapkan keinginannya untuk kembali lagi suatu hari nanti dan meminta James berjanji untuk membawanya kembali kesini. Namun saat mereka hendak pulang, James tidak sengaja meninggalkan videotape itu. Sayang sepulangnya dari sana, Mary tiba-tiba menderita penyakit terminal yang membuat tubuhnya menjadi sangat lemah dan mengalami perubahan suasana hati yang hebat, sampai-sampai ia kerap melampiaskan kemarahannya pada James. Bahkan dokter yang menanganinya memperkirakan hidup Mary hanya tersisa kurang dari 3 tahun lagi dan memberitahu bahwa tidak ada pengobatan yang efektif. James telah berusaha menghibur Mary dengan menjenguknya dari waktu ke waktu dan membawakan bunga, namun Mary malah menolak pemberian bunga itu mentah-mentah, berpikir James pasti menganggap dirinya menjijikkan dan mengusirnya dari sana. Mary bahkan sempat mengatakan bahwa ia lebih baik mati saja daripada harus menderita sepanjang hidupnya, tapi suasana hatinya ini juga bisa langsung berubah, dimana setelah memarahi James habis-habisan, ia langsung menyesal dan meminta James untuk menemaninya. Situasi ini membuat James bingung tentang apa yang benar untuk dilakukan, sehingga seiring berjalannya waktu, ia semakin jarang menjenguk istrinya. James mulai tenggelam dalam perasaan depresi, mengetahui bahwa kehidupannya juga ikut hancur bersamaan dengan kondisi Mary yang tak kunjung membaik, ia tidak bisa lagi menjalani kehidupan yang normal. Satu-satunya cara untuk melarikan diri dari rasa sakit dan kesepian yang ia rasakan ini adalah dengan mengonsumsi alkohol. James perlahan-lahan mulai membenci Mary. Satu tahun sebelum kejadian utama di Silent Hill 2, Mary yang masih dirawat di rumah sakit bertemu dengan seorang anak yatim piatu bernama Laura yang juga merupakan pasien di bawah asuhan perawat yang sama, yaitu Rachel. Mary pada saat itu sudah bisa menerima kondisinya dan menemukan ketenangan dalam pikirannya terhadap kota Silent Hill, sehingga ia sering bercerita kepada Laura tentang kenangan indahnya bersama James di kota Silent Hill. Keduanya menjalin hubungan yang sangat akrab layaknya ibu dan anak, salah satu keinginan Mary yang tidak bisa terwujud, yaitu memiliki seorang anak. Namun Laura tidak pernah menyukai James yang selalu terlihat memperlakukan Mary dengan kasar setiap kali datang menjenguk, padahal Mary tidak pernah berhenti menunggu James di rumah sakit. Di hari-hari terakhir hidupnya, Mary menulis surat perpisahan untuk Laura dan James dan menitipkannya pada perawat Rachel untuk nantinya diberikan saat ia sudah meninggal. Mary diizinkan untuk pulang ke rumah, dimana selama berada di rumah, James ditugaskan untuk menjadi pengasuhnya. Namun di mata James, Mary hanyalah beban. Ia tidak lagi memiliki perasaan cinta yang sama, dan semakin lama melihat Mary menderita, keadaan emosionalnya semakin memburuk, hingga akhirnya ia memutuskan untuk mengakhiri penderitaan sang istri dengan membekapnya menggunakan bantal... James seketika menyesali perbuatannya ketika ia menerima surat perpisahan yang ditulis oleh Mary, surat sama yang bisa kita lihat di beberapa ending. Ia baru sadar bahwa rupanya Mary masih sangat mencintainya. Tidak bisa menerima kenyataan ini, James mulai menekan memorinya dan membuat memori palsu untuk meyakinkan dirinya bahwa Mary sudah meninggal 3 tahun yang lalu karena penyakit terminal yang dideritanya. Sementara itu untuk surat Mary, ia hanya mengingat bagian awalnya saja, ketika Mary mengatakan ia sedang menunggunya di tempat spesial mereka berdua di kota Silent Hill. Untuk itu tanpa kesadaran penuh, James meletakkan jasad istrinya di bangku belakang mobil dan berangkat menuju kota Silent Hill untuk mencari keberadaan Mary. Ia tidak menyadari bahwa ia telah dipanggil oleh kota Silent Hill untuk menjalani penebusan dosa atas apa yang ia lakukan di masa lalu. Selama berada di kota Silent Hill, James terkena dampak dari fenomena Fog World, dimana semua hal yang tersembunyi di alam bawah sadarnya, entah itu keinginan, trauma, atau kenangan masa lalu, terwujud ke realita sebagai sesuatu yang familiar atau justru menakutkan baginya. Artinya, sebagian besar elemen yang kita lihat di sepanjang game, seperti monster, sosok familiar, dokumen, dan lain sebagainya, sebenarnya berasal dari alam bawah sadar James dan memiliki makna tersendiri. Monster Lying Figure digambarkan memiliki tubuh bagian atas yang menyerupai kantong mayat dengan gerakan seperti pasien rumah sakit yang sedang menggeliat kesakitan. Monster ini lahir dari perasaan terkurung James ketika ia tidak bisa lagi menjalani kehidupan normal sejak sang istri, Mary, menderita penyakit terminal. Nama yang diberikan, yaitu ‘Lying Figure’ atau ‘Sosok Berbaring’ mengacu pada Mary yang selalu berbaring di atas ranjang. Monster Mannequin digambarkan memiliki sepasang kaki di bagian atas dan bawah tubuhnya dan tidak memiliki penampilan manusia. Hal ini disebabkan oleh James yang menolak untuk mengingat siapa yang mereka wakili dan apa yang telah ia lakukan pada Mary. Satu kejadian yang terasa aneh adalah ketika 2 monster Mannequin diserang oleh Pyramid Head di Wood Side Apartment. Adegan ini sebenarnya merupakan upaya James dalam mengingatkan dirinya akan realita yang terjadi. Namun karena Mannequin terlahir dari nafsu yang ada dalam diri James, maka gerakan Pyramid Head dibuat sedemikian rupa agar terasa erotis, tapi sebenarnya tidak ada sama sekali unsur yang mengarah ke pemenuhan hasrat secara paksa. Pyramid Head adalah monster yang terbentuk dari rasa bersalah dan siksaan batin dalam diri James yang ingin menghukum dirinya. Ia hadir untuk menyadarkan James akan kesalahannya, dan untuk itulah, ia sering terlihat sedang menyerang monster lain, termasuk membunuh Maria berulang kali. Saat James tersadar, Pyramid Head mengakhiri hidup dan berhenti mengganggu. Monster Flesh Lip digambarkan seperti makhluk yang terkurung di dalam jeruji besi dengan keberadaan mulut di bagian perutnya. Makhluk ini mewakili ingatan James tentang Mary di ranjang rumah sakit, dimana jeruji besi adalah rangka tempat tidur Mary dan dagingnya adalah kulit Mary yang rusak sebagai akibat dari penyakit yang ia derita. Sementara itu, untuk ciri yang paling menonjol, yaitu mulut Flesh Lip, merupakan penggambaran tentang Mary yang tidak jarang membentak James selama ia terbaring lemah di rumah sakit, jadi mulut dapat mewakili gejolak batin dan serangan verbal. Menariknya, sebelum Flesh Lip muncul, tidak ada satupun monster yang digambarkan memiliki mulut, tapi setelah itu, semua monster tiba-tiba memiliki mulut. Monster Bubble Head Nurse digambarkan menyerupai perawat dengan topeng yang menutupi permukaan wajah mereka, dimana bagian tengah ke bawah dari topeng yang berbentuk wajah bayi melambangkan keinginan James dan Mary untuk memiliki anak. Rasa sesak yang dialami oleh Nurse juga merupakan representasi dari ingatan bawah sadar James saat ia membekap Mary menggunakan bantal. Monster Mandarin melambangkan kesedihan dan ketidakberdayaan yang tak tertahankan. Karena alasan ini, mereka biasanya berjalan menggelantung di sisi bawah lantai bukan di atas. Abstract Daddy digambarkan menyerupai 2 sosok yang sedang dalam posisi intim. Monster ini sebenarnya bukan terbentuk dari alam bawah sadar James, melainkan dari trauma Angela Orosco yang menerima perbuatan tidak pantas dari ayah dan saudaranya. Tapi wujud monster Abstract Daddy yang kita lihat adalah wujud yang muncul dari pengelihatan James, bukan dari pengelihatan Angela. Menurut Masahiro Ito selaku orang yang bertanggung jawab atas pembuatan desain monster, Angela melihat Abstract Daddy dalam wujud yang sama sekali berbeda, ia memilih untuk membiarkan para pemain berimajinasi sendiri, tapi yang pasti, wujud Abstract Daddy di pengelihatan Angela tidak akan semenarik wujudnya di pengelihatan James. Sementara itu, wujud monster Mary di akhir permainan mewujudkan emosi James yang bertentangan terhadap Mary di hari-hari terakhirnya. Itu tadi adalah semua monster yang muncul dalam game Silent Hill 2, tapi masih ada satu karakter yang terbentuk dari alam bawah sadar James, yaitu Maria. Maria digambarkan sebagai seorang wanita yang memiliki ciri-ciri mirip dengan Mary, tapi bedanya, ia memiliki sifat yang lebih agresif dan berpenampilan terbuka. Hal ini bisa terjadi karena sosok Maria sebenarnya merupakan konstruksi mental atau khayalan yang terbentuk dari imajinasi James tentang istrinya, Mary. Atau lebih jelasnya, Maria diciptakan dari keputusasaan James untuk bertemu dengan Mary dan mengisi kekosongan yang selama ini tidak bisa dipenuhi oleh Mary, termasuk keperluan untuk memenuhi hasratnya, menjelaskan kenapa Maria digambarkan lebih terbuka dan tidak jarang berusaha menggoda James. Meski hanya terbentuk dari alam bawah sadar James, Maria juga samar-samar memiliki ingatan Mary, dan karena itu, ia memiliki keinginan yang kuat untuk menyelamatkan Laura. Selain monster dan karakter, sebenarnya masih banyak elemen di kota Silent Hill yang terwujud dari alam bawah sadar James, seperti beberapa catatan yang berbicara tentang pria aneh pemabuk yang jelas-jelas mengacu pada James; mobil James yang terparkir di belakang Neely’s Bar, meskipun platnya berbeda, tapi warnanya sama persis; foto-foto aneh yang menggambarkan kehidupan James dan Mary sebelum tertimpa malapetaka; dokumen mengenai 3 pasien di Brookhaven Hospital yang tidak bisa disembuhkan oleh sang dokter, yang dimana hal ini dipercaya merujuk pada James karena ketiga nama pasien dimulai dari huruf ‘J’; tubuh seorang pria tertutup kain di Wood Side Apartmen yang adalah tubuh James sendiri, dan lain sebagainya. Apapun itu, pada akhirnya nasib James ditentukan dari ending mana yang kita dapatkan. Dalam Leave Ending, James berhasil menghadapi perasaan bersalahnya dan meninggalkan kota Silent Hill bersama Laura, sesuai keinginan Mary. Dalam In Water Ending, James tidak bisa memaafkan dirinya atas apa yang telah ia lakukan pada Mary dan memutuskan untuk mengakhiri hidup bersama jasad Mary yang dibawanya di bangku belakang mobil, sama juga dengan Stillness Ending. Dalam Maria Ending, James malah berakhir terjebak dalam perasaan bersalahnya dan lebih memilih untuk menerima sosok delusi yang ia ciptakan atas Mary, yaitu Maria. Ia lebih senang hidup dalam kepura-puraan daripada menghadapi realita. Dalam Bliss Ending, James memutuskan untuk mengonsumsi White Claudia agar ia bisa mendapatkan kembali kehidupan bahagianya bersama Mary, tapi semua itu hanya terjadi dalam kepalanya. Sedangkan 2 ending sisanya, yaitu Dog Ending dan UFO Ending, tidak usah dijelaskan lagi. Itu adalah True Endingny- Sekarang, kita akan membahas sedikit tentang 3 korban lain yang juga mendapatkan panggilan dari kota Silent Hill, yaitu Eddie Dombrowski, Angela Orosco, dan Laura. Eddie Dombrowski kerap dibully oleh teman-temannya semasa sekolah karena kelebihan berat badan, namun salah satu pembully yang paling parah adalah seorang pemain sepak bola di SMA yang masih terus membullynya bahkan setelah mereka sudah lulus. Untuk itu sebagai pembalasan, Eddie membunuh anjing peliharaan sang pembully, dan saat sang pembully datang menghampirinya, ia menembak kakinya sampai lumpuh. Tidak ingin disalahkan atas perbuatannya itu, Eddie memutuskan untuk melarikan diri, dan seolah mendapatkan panggilan, ia sampai di kota Silent Hill. Dalam intro Silent Hill 2 original, Eddie terlihat sedang terduduk di samping mobil van sambil memegangi sebuah peta dan ditemani oleh Laura. Hal ini menandakan bahwa mereka berdua tidak sengaja berpapasan saat hendak pergi menuju kota Silent Hill, dan memang benar, melalui Book of Lost Memories, yaitu dokumen tambahan yang dicetak di sisi belakang buku panduan resmi Silent Hill 3, dikatakan bahwa Laura dan Eddie bertemu secara kebetulan dalam perjalanan menuju Silent Hill. Mobil van putih yang digunakan oleh Eddie adalah mobil van sama yang bisa kita lihat di awal permainan. Nah selama penelusurannya di kota Silent Hill, Eddie mengalami fenomena Fog World, dimana ia terus diganggu oleh sosok pembully yang terwujud ke realita dari alam bawah sadarnya. Seberapa banyak pun ia membunuh, sang pembully akan terus bermunculan lagi dan lagi, menjelaskan keberadaan mayat seorang pria dengan perawakan sama persis yang bisa kita temukan di ruang pendingin. Bukan hanya disana, kenyataannya, mayat yang ditemukan mati di kulkas dan di kafetaria juga adalah mayat si pembully. Hal ini secara perlahan membuat Eddie kehilangan kewarasannya, tapi tidak seperti James, ia sudah tahu cara kerja Silent Hill, terbukti dari bagaimana saat James menyarankannya untuk mencari pertolongan, ia menganggap James sebagai orang yang munafik. Ia tahu James juga datang kesini karena mendapatkan panggilan dari kota Silent Hill, yang artinya, James juga melakukan sesuatu yang buruk di masa lalu. Laura, di sisi lain, ingin pergi ke kota Silent Hill untuk mencari Mary setelah salah mengira surat peninggalan Mary sebagai undangan baginya untuk bertemu di tempat yang tenang di kota Silent Hill. Tapi karena ia masih seorang gadis yang polos dan tidak melakukan kejahatan di masa lalu, maka baginya, kota Silent Hill hanyalah kota berkabut yang tidak berpenghuni. Tidak ada satupun monster atau abnormalitas yang mengganggunya. Itulah kenapa ia selalu tampak kebingungan ketika James memperingatkannya akan bahaya di kota Silent Hill. Angela Orosco, seperti yang sudah dijelaskan di babak plot, ia mengalami trauma berat atas perlakuan tidak pantas yang ia terima dari ayahnya, Thomas Orosco, dan saudaranya. Ibunya tidak pernah peduli padanya, mengatakan Angela layak menerima semua itu. Hal ini secara tidak langsung menciptakan trauma dan rasa benci dalam diri Angela terhadap laki-laki, menjelaskan kenapa ia selalu berusaha menghindar atau ketakutan ketika James mendekatinya. Pada satu titik, ibu Angela pergi meninggalkan keluarganya dan tidak pernah terdengar lagi, kemungkinan mengakhiri hidup. Sementara itu, Angela sendiri sudah pernah mengunjungi rumah sakit untuk memeriksakan kondisi kesehatan mentalnya, namun dokter hanya meresepkan obat-obatan yang tidak mempan. Setelah lulus SMA, ia sempat kabur dari rumah, tapi segera ditemukan dan diseret kembali oleh sang ayah. Hingga pada suatu malam, Angela yang sudah muak dengan semua ini memutuskan untuk menghabisi sang ayah menggunakan pisau dapur dan melarikan diri dari rumah. Menurut novelnya, ia juga menghabisi saudaranya. Sadar tidak ada seorang pun yang bisa dimintai bantuan, Angela mencapai kota Silent Hill, seolah mendapatkan panggilan. Disana ia mencoba mencari ibunya yang menghilang, berpikir sang ibu adalah harapan terakhir baginya untuk tetap hidup. Begitulah kisah mendalam yang dibawakan dalam game Silent Hill 2. Bagaimanapun juga meski fenomena Fog World dapat mengganggu psikis seseorang, namun secara tidak langsung fenomena itu telah menjadikan kota Silent Hill sebagai kota penebusan dosa bagi siapapun yang memiliki trauma di masa lalu atau melakukan suatu kejahatan. Tergantung dengan bagaimana orang itu menyikapinya, ia bisa saja berubah menjadi orang yang lebih baik dan tetap melanjutkan hidup atau malah sebaliknya, terjebak dalam trauma dan...

Pada zaman dahulu ada seorang gadis kecil berjubah merah bernama Red Riding Hood. Suatu hari ia mendapatkan kabar bahwa neneknya sakit dan disuruh ke rumah nenek untuk memberikan buah, sayur, dan obat-obatan. Dalam perjalanan, Red Redwood bertemu dengan seekor serigala yang misterius. Dia bertanya, "Hei, gadis kecil, mau pergi ke mana kau?" "Aku ingin pergi ke rumah nenek untuk menguantar obat-obatan. Kamu mau eh om Anterin?" "Eh, tidak. Terima kasih, Tuan Serigala. Aku bisa sendiri." Red Riding Hood pun pergi menuju rumah nenek. Akan tetapi, si serigala memiliki rencana lain untuk si Red Riding Hood. Nenek, ini aku Red Riding Hood. Aku masuk ya. [Musik] [Musik] [Tepuk tangan] [Musik] [Tepuk tangan] [Musik] [Tepuk tangan] Gimana adik-adik? Apa yang bisa kita pelajari dari cerita Red Riding Hood ini? Yap, betul sekali. Jangan berbicara ke orang yang enggak dikenal ya. Itu Pak, orang asing yang masuk diam-diam. Oh. Oh [ __ ] Persiapkan bola mata baru kalian. Obat pencuci otak paling ampuh karena jiwa kita akan mulai menghitam. Karena hari ini mari kita bahas. [Musik] Bagi yang masih belum tahu, Red Riding Woods adalah sebuah game sakit njir. Saya kira sequel-nya yang akhirnya bisa bikin saya menyesal diberi kemampuan melihat tapi malah adiknya yang bikin saya jangan dekatin saya. Boleh dibilang relationship saya dengan ini game cukup rumitlah ya. Di satu sisi, game ini berhasil bikin karakter Red Riding Hood memiliki dimensi dan juga back story yang tragik. Sehingga kita tahu kenapa ini sumon beneran OP di Black Soul 1. Tapi di sisi lain, saking tragiknya cerita yang dikisahkan, saya sempat mutusin buat [ __ ] di series dan mempersiapkan diri buat detail FBI tentang file yang sudah tersimpan di PC saya. Red Hood Woods merupakan sebuah RPG maker Dark Fantasy Souls like Fairy Tales Inspired Erois Game yang diciptakan oleh Sushi Yusa Toro atau Toro. Saya tahu ini game berupa jandra souls like. Jadi jelaslah gameennya bakal lumayan sulit. Tapi buat adegan echinya ya mending enggak usah kita bahas lah kalau enggak mau otak kalian meleleh kayak boroh. Balik ke game-nya. Kalau misalnya Black Souls 1 ini boleh dibilang prototype dari Black Souls 2, Red Riding Woods boleh dibilang cuma coretan kasar dari bocah EG jam 5.00 pagi. Battle system yang enggak balance sama sekali. Map desain yang generic. Bahkan power scaling yang lebih bullshit. daripada Elden Ring, you know. Kerasa kayak fans Brad Souls Game yang taruhan patung kaki Melina buat disuruh bikin game Souls like dalam 2D. Game yang sangat kacau secara gameplay. Tapi buat story-nya iya ini barang beda cerita. Red Riding Woods bercerita bukan tentang our favorite theess andad night grim akan tetapi tentang our petite bad ass God killer kita yaitu Red Hood. Di mana pada suatu hari yang penuh badai dirinya ditinggal olehnya. E, Red Hood. E, nenek mau pergi sebentar untuk beli susu dan nenek akan balik eh entah kapan. Jadi, jangan pergi keluar rumah ya, karena banyak monster dan e jang jangan masuk ke basement, oke? Jangan masuk ke basement. Absolutely no. [Musik] Jadi, mari kita masuk ke basem di sana. Iya, boleh dibilang bukan basem biasa, lebih ke penjara pribadi nenek dengan berbagai cermin di dalamnya. Daripada kita nganggur, mending kita cek diri sendiri enggak sih? Alamak cantiknya. Wow. Welcome to Fox World. Berdasarkan instin gamer saya, di setiap dunia cermin yang ada di Red Riding Woods ini, kita harus membasmi setiap bos yang berada di dalamnya. Gimana, Red Hood? Kamu siap melakukan petualangan panjang ini bersama saya? Eh, eh, ke mana kamu? Oh, ada kupu-kupu. Mari kita tes battle system-nya dulu, gak sih? Well, setidaknya kita aman di bas Oh, iya saya lupa. Ini Poro. Jangan disalah sangka dengan Puro. Walaupun keduanya sama-sama good boy hitam, kelihatan kayak anjing dan siap bikin kalian ngebuang PC karena tindakan mereka. Good boy satu ini memiliki peran penting di game Red Woods. Dia bisa sebagai shop dan juga level up senjata kita. Sangat good boy, bukan? Oke, balik ke cerminnya. Jadi, buat battle dengan para monsternya kita gak bisa asal gebuk-gebuk hajar-hajar. Mereka ini monster tapi mereka punya kode. Ini game pakai turn base strategy di setiap battle-nya. Kalian tinggal tunggu bar di samping ini full, terus kalian bisa nyerang, bisa langsung pukul, pakai magic, atau mastery. Terserah kalian mau pakai item atau kalau kalian pus tinggal. Sangat simpel bukan? Jadi, apa yang membedakan ini game dengan battle system lainnya? Apakah formula tingkat kesulitan Dark Soul bakal masuk ke sini? Well, di awal mungkin ini game kerasa kayak Dark Souls. Sulit, dikit-dikit healing, dan kerasa kalau attack musuh sesakit attack kalian. Tapi kalian dengan jalan-jalan dikit aja, kalian bisa ngerasain level one crook ke level 1000 Astarot. The Devower of Gamer Girl Juice. Ini game gampang banget, Dir. Kalian jadi op saking gampangnya, bahkan boss battle-nya, you know, aspek yang membuat setiap Soul series terkenal banget. Boss battle yang susah sampai mau hancurin stick bikin kita ngerasain Skizo Suparu 4 jam stuck di layar yang sama. Dan jangan lupakan, oh my god, kakinya boy di Red Hood ini jujur aja desain bosnya masih top tier kayak game Souls lainnya. Kita ambil contoh bos pertama kita, The Fog Monster. Secara desain kelihatan banget kalau ini makhluk merupakan monster dari mimpi buruk autor. Bahkan kalau kalian kira ini desain sudah lumayan ngeri, second face-nya man, I'm sorry yang fobia sama lubang. Tapi this [ __ ] is tight. Wow. Walaupun begitu, [Musik] very easy. Selevel kroco malahan. Kelihatan jelas kan seberapa enggak balance ini game. Anyway, kita lanjut aja ke dunia kedua, Lake World. So, katanya di level ini kita harus ngebantai The Fish. Tapi kita harus masuk ke abis terlebih dahulu terus nyari sebuah tempel. Terus gimana sih cara kita bisa masuk ke bawah laut? Emang kita bisa? Oh [ __ ] Ya, sudah dibantai rupanya. Well, dunia ketiga, here we come. Selamat datang di Darkwood. Di mana di level ini bakal kebagi ke dua bagian, yaitu The Mad King Castle dan juga The Last of Us if it's good. Kayak biasa kita bakal melakukan genocida, bunuh teman kita sendiri dan juga ngebantai The Mat King di istananya. Tapi oh! The real boss muncul. The beast! sebuah representasi dari monster kegelapan. Sebuah lubang kosong di mana kalau kalian tatap akan menatap kalian kembali. M, bagaimana cara kita mengalahkan bos Sedewa ini mau main? Pertanyaan bagus. Biden BL. Well, tugas kita selesai. Dunia berikutnya Snow World. So, di dunia ini cara buat ngalahin bosnya cukup unik. Gak kayak dunia sebelumnya di World Salju ini dunianya bulat. Real, coy. Kalau di dunia sebelumnya map yang sudah ditentukan sudah didesain dengan jelas, tinggal ikutin jalur dan bomada bim kalian bisa hantam bosnya. Nah, di level 1 ini, Toro melakukan sesuatu yang sedikit spesial. Ia menambahkan sedikit ilmu hitam yang membuat dunianya kayak bumi asli. Kalau kalian lari ke atas, ke kiri, ke kanan, walaupun kelihatannya tanpa ujung, lama-kelamaan kalian bisa balik ke titik kalian spawn bulat, bukan? Nah, gimana cara agar kita bisa lepas dari dunia satu ini? Simpel, Red Hood harus melawan musuh yang gak bisa kita lawan dengan spam attack. Red Hood harus melawan masa lalunya. Wom wom wom. Flashback Wanning. Rada kelam dan banyak kekerasan seksual sih di flashback ini. Bagi kalian yang gak mau detailnya, skip aja ke sini. [Musik] Pada zaman dahulu, Red Hood tinggal bersama kakek dan neneknya setelah kedua orang tuanya menghilang. Di sana, karena keadaan ekonomi zaman medieval rada sulit, Red Hood diharuskan bekerja, yaitu mempekerjakan dirinya. Walaupun kehidupan sehari-harinya penuh dengan kegiatan seksual yang sangat tidak friendly, Red Hood masih harus mengalami dan menahan penderitaan di dalam keluarganya. Di mana di satu sisi si nenek sangat menyayangi dan memperhatikan Red Hood. Kakeknya boleh dibilang setara dengan orang yang perawakannya kayak goblin pemangsa janda. Red Hood dipaksa untuk diam-diam dari neneknya tentang adegan memuaskan si kakek. Akan tetapi, Red Hood adalah protagonis dari sebuah game fairytale kelam dengan sedikit bumbus soul series. Jadi apa yang Redhood lakukan? Pada sebuah hari penuh badai, Redh Hood membunuh kakeknya dengan sebuah pisau langsung ke leher dan memotong jasadnya ke bagian-bagian kecil yang akhirnya potongan daging tersebut diberikan ke serigala terdekat. Dan dari sanalah Red Hood dan Poro berteman. Sebuah kisah sebelum tidur yang indah bukan? Wih, kalian dengar itu? Itu suara [Musik] Biden Blast. [Musik] Ya, ya masih segampang itu sih. Anyway, ada Demon King. Ternyata dengan berhasil menghancurkan empat dewa dari empat dunia cermin yang ada, realita dunia dari Red Hood mulai hancur. Tapi ternyata plot twist lebih besarnya lagi adalah selama ini Red Hood sedang terjebak di dunia mimpi. Untuk bisa bebas sepenuhnya dari dunia mimpi ini, Red Hood harus ngebuluh dua bos lagi agar Redh Hood bisa masuk ke mimpi yang lebih dalam dan bertemu dengan orang yang telah menjebak Red Hood. Setelah kita menghantam The Zombie Dragon dan The Hollow Snake, kita bakal dihadang oleh Poro. Dia seperti sedang kelaparan, sedang haus darah, sedang menerkam mangsa baru, dan oh [ __ ] kita diserang. Hah, gampang ternyata. Jadi alasan kenapa Our Good Boy satu ini tiba-tiba jadi agresif karena Poro setelah diberi makan kakek legend A5 suguhan dari Red Hood rasa haus darah akan daging manusia mulai tumbuh di dalam tubuh Poro. Awalnya ia berusaha untuk menahan rasa lapar tersebut namun perlahan-lahan mentalnya terkikis oleh rasa lapar tadi dan berakhir dengan menyerang Red Hut karena you know Red Hud itu manusia. Setelah dikalahkan, Poro juga sadar dan meminta maaf karena telah menyerang satu-satunya teman yang ia punya. Mereka berakhir dengan berpelukan dan Poro berjanji akan berada di samping Red Hood untuk melindunginya. Oh, ending yang manis enggak sih buat maut ini? Wait, kenapa mereka buka baju? Ah! Ah! Ah! Mataku, mataku ambil mataku. So, karena mau main sudah terbakar adegan suci, biarkan saya yang ngelanjutin. Jujur aja kalian gak mau lihat adegan olahraga satu ini. Lebih parah dari Zines, Jir, I come for some action but not this action, man. Well, yang bikin ini game lebih parah dari kakaknya adalah di game ini gak ada opsi buat disable eisin. Jadinya begitu kita mainin, yes, kita bakal disukuin sama banyak banget [ __ ] Kalian jalan ada [ __ ] kalian ketemu orang [ __ ] Uh, apa ini? [ __ ] Oh my God, banyak banget bokepnya. Holy [ __ ] man. Setelah sedikit permainan antara Boro dan Redut, mereka lanjut masuk ke dunia mimpi lebih dalam. Ke sebuah kota penusakubus, kembali ke Foxwor, balik ke tempat kita enggak sengaja bunuh peri, kembali ke dunia salju, hingga Red Hood kembali ke rumah neneknya. Ternyata yang selama ini telah menjabak Red Hood ke dalam dunia mimpi adalah neneknya sendiri. Well, lebih tepatnya representasi dari neneknya yang telah diciptakan oleh Red Hood. Well, sini saya jelasin. So, di malam Red Hood menjadi ahli kemasan, ternyata neneknya belum pergi dan melihat aksi cucunya dengan keji membunuh dan memutilasi si kakek sampai memberikannya ke sebuah serigala. Mengetahui hal tersebut, neneknya terkejut dan ketakutan. Redut yang sadar kalau ada saksi yang lolos mengejar nenek tadi yang berakhir dengan neneknya tersandung dan terjebur ke dalam sungai yang berakhir dengan meninggal tenggelam. mengetahui bahwa dirinya telah tidak sengaja membunuh neneknya, satu-satunya orang yang baik ke dirinya, Red Hood jatuh depresi dan menyalahkan dirinya sebagai pembunuh neneknya. Dan berakhir dengan rasa tersebut menumpuk dan menciptakan sebuah monster, yaitu neneknya sendiri yang memerangkapnya dalam sebuah dunia mimpi. Sudah jelas final battle ya, Teman-teman. Biden Blast. Hah, masih belum hancur ternyata. Waktunya saya untuk sedikit serius. Aktifkan Kings Order, Ruinnus Win, Silent Bubble, Poison. Dan untuk ultimate saya hidup Jokobi. [Tepuk tangan] Dengan dikalahkannya monster inti di dunia mimpi Red Hood, perlahan-lahan dunia ini mulai hancur. Poro dan Redh Hood saling mengucapkan perpisahan mereka, saling tatap-menatap, menyatakan perasaan cinta mereka, dan berpelukan. No, no, no, no. Enggak lagi, Boys. No, no, no. Kenapa buka baju, Man? Oh, w mataku. Well, boys, itu tadi adalah Red Hood Woods, sebuah game yang jujur aja jangan kalian mainin. Enggak worthed it sih buat harga yang harus kalian bayar kayak sekarang ini. Dan kalian mau main Red Hood Woods? Dah, gitu aja. T Hello guys kembali lagi di channel Droomp dan selamat datang di plot Halu: The Fracture Halu: The Fracture adalah game horor garapan Hwaye Studio yang rilis pada tanggal 28 Agustus tahun 2025 untuk PC. Sang developer sendiri merupakan seorang streamer asal Indonesia yang sering memainkan game horor. Halu: The Fracture mengangkat kisah mengenai seorang anak muda yang mengalami berbagai teror mengerikan di kehidupan sehari – harinya. Bukan tanpa alasan, melainkan ada sesuatu yang memulai semua ini dan akan terungkap secara perlahan. Tokoh utama dalam game ini adalah seorang anak muda bernama Ryan. Kini ia sedang bekerja paruh waktu di sebuah mini market di sela – sela kesibukannya berkuliah. Baginya, kehidupannya bukanlah kehidupan yang luar biasa, tapi paling tidak cukup untuk terus berjalan. Proses perenungan harus berhenti saat ia mendengar suara bel tanda datangnya pelanggan. Ryan segera beranjak keluar dari toilet untuk melayani para pelanggan. Setelah melayani pelanggan kedua yang datang, shift kerjanya berakhir, dan seperti hari – hari biasa, ia pulang menggunakan bus. Tiba di perhentian, Ryan masih harus menempuh jarak yang cukup jauh menuju kostnya dengan berjalan kaki, belum lagi penerangan jalan sangat minim. Ryan mengeluhkan rasa lelah yang ia alami, mengungkapkan keinginannya untuk tidur setelah makan dan mandi. Sepanjang perjalanan, ia mendengar suara obrolan orang – orang yang tidak pernah berhenti, sedangkan di area taman bermain, terlihat seorang pria dengan baju basket sedang berdiri tanpa melakukan apapun. Sebelum mencapai kost, ada sebuah belokan ke kanan, namun tiap kali berjalan kesana, langkah Ryan akan langsung berhenti, ia tidak suka melewati jalan itu. Tiba di area kost, Ryan bergumam seorang diri, mengatakan bahwa ia sudah lupa sejak kapan ia pindah dari ruang 208 ke ruang 201. Di lantai atas, ia sempat bertemu dengan sang penjaga gedung yang tampaknya sedang bahagia, terlihat dari senyuman lebar di wajah dan bagaimana ia sedang menyenandungkan lagu... Ryan tidak mau terlalu mengurusi orang lain. Masuk ke dalam ruang 201, ia langsung mengambil frozen food di dalam kulkas, memanaskannya menggunakan microwave, tidak sengaja menjatuhkan makanan, lagi, dan... lagi, sebelum akhirnya menyantap makanan tersebut. Menyantap makan malam hanya seorang diri benar – benar terasa sangat sunyi. Begitu perut terisi, Ryan lanjut mandi untuk menyegarkan pikiran. Ia sebenarnya ingin segera tidur, namun masih ada tugas kuliah yang harus dikerjakan. Untuk itu, setelah selesai mandi dan tanpa mempedulikan tulisan minta tolong pada cermin kamar mandi, Ryan bergegas menuju kamar untuk mengerjakan tugas. Di saat yang bersamaan, sebuah figura foto jatuh mengalihkan perhatiannya. Foto itu menunjukkan masa – masa bahagianya bersama kedua orang tuanya, lebih tepatnya ketika ia menjadi juara dalam pertandingan bola basket. Foto itu selalu mengingatkannya akan sesuatu yang tidak ingin ia ingat. Sebuah pesan masuk, berasal dari seorang wanita bernama Sarah yang mengajak Ryan untuk bertemu di hari Sabtu, mengklaim bahwa mereka sudah sangat lama tidak bertemu. Ryan membiarkan pesan tersebut dan fokus mengerjakan tugas, bertekad untuk lulus tepat waktu karena beasiswanya hanya berlaku sampai semester delapan... Keesokan hari saat bekerja di mini market, Ryan bertemu dengan seorang pelanggan aneh yang mengenakan hoodie dan topi hitam. Sang pelanggan bertanya, apakah Ryan percaya dengan Dunia Semu, dunia dimana kita bisa mendapatkan apapun, mulai dari kekayaan, kekuatan, atau bahkan orang yang paling kita rindukan. Saat Ryan mengungkapkan ketidaktertarikannya terhadap hal itu, ia mengatakan bahwa cepat atau lambat, Ryan akan mengerti. Tidak lama setelah sang pelanggan misterius pergi, datanglah pelanggan kedua yang entah kenapa tampak sangat familiar. Pelanggan berinisial W ini sadar bahwa Ryan kurang semangat, dan untuk itu setelah membayar belanjaannya, iapun menyampaikan kata – kata hari ini sembari berjoget – joget... Puas berpantun, Bang W pun pergi meninggalkan mini market. Kemudian pelanggan ketiga adalah pemain basket yang ditemui Ryan di taman bermain dalam perjalanan pulang. Ia membeli frozen food. Hari ini lebih sepi daripada biasanya, sehingga Ryan memutuskan untuk makan sebenatar agar nanti saat pulang ia bisa langsung fokus mengerjakan tugas. Setelah memanaskan makanan dan tidak sengaja menjatuhkannya lagi, ia melahap makanan tersebut... Pulang menggunakan bus, Ryan kembali mengeluh, merasa seluruh kehidupannya hanya ia gunakan untuk bekerja dan bekerja tanpa memiliki waktu untuk dirinya sendiri. Bukan hanya tubuhnya yang lelah, melainkan semuanya. Di tengah perjalanan, ia dipanggil oleh sang pemain basket yang sedang berada di taman bermain. Berjalan mendekat, Ryan langsung menyadari bagian kaki kanan sang pemain basket yang diperban, mengharuskannya untuk menggunakan alat bantu jalan. Alasan sang pemain basket memanggil Ryan adalah karena ia sadar mereka sering berpapasan. Ryan memberitahu bahwa ia tinggal di Kost Mawar Hitam dekat area ini, dan secara kebetulan, rupanya sang pemain basket juga tinggal di kost yang sama, lebih tepatnya di ruang 208. Mengenalkan dirinya sebagai Michael, ia mengaku kakinya terkilir saat bermain basket, sehingga kini kedua orang tuanya datang untuk merawat. Selain itu, ia juga memberitahu bahwa ibunya memasak ayam kecap dan mengajak Ryan untuk makan bersama. Meski ayam kecap adalah makanan kesukaan Ryan, Ryan menolak ajakan itu dengan alasan masih ada tugas yang harus ia kerjakan. Ucapan Michael membuat Ryan semakin sedih, mengingat ia tidak memiliki tempat untuk pulang. Tiba di kost, ia mendapati sang penjaga gedung sedang membersihkan tempat sampah, dan saat ia masuk ke dalam ruang 201, ia mendengar suara tertawa... Ryan tidak begitu mempedulikan suara itu. Setelah mengungkapkan rasa sukanya terhadap sang idola bernama Michael Jayden, Ryan meneruskan tugas kuliah sembari merenungkan kehidupannya yang terasa sangat sunyi. Beberapa orang akan langsung disambut aroma masakan dan suara yang menyenangkan saat pulang ke rumah, sedangkan ia sendiri disambut oleh layar laptop dan deadline tugas. Orang lain tidak usah begitu khawatir saat jatuh sakit, karena ada yang akan merawat dan peduli padanya. Sedangkan dirinya, bahkan tidak memiliki waktu untuk mengeluh, tugas harus selesai dan kehidupan tetap berjalan agar ia bisa bertahan. Selama ini, Ryan harus pura – pura kuat di tengah sempitnya kehidupan... Keesokan malam setelah pekerjaannya berakhir, Ryan pulang dengan rasa lelah sama yang ia rasakan tiap harinya, belum lagi upah yang ia dapatkan tidak cukup untuk mendapat kehidupan yang layak. Mendekati area taman bermain, ia melihat bola basket memantul dan hilang begitu saja. Masuk ke dalam area taman, Ryan duduk di atas ayunan bergerak untuk menenangkan diri sesaat. Ia sadar tidak seperti biasa, area sekitar kini benar – benar sunyi, “mungkin semua orang sedang sibuk bahagia”, pikirnya. Bola basket kedua dilempar dari belokan kanan dekat kostnya. Meski hal ini membuat Ryan kebingungan, ia tidak begitu peduli. Sampai di kost, Ryan membuang 3 kantong sampah yang sudah mulai memenuhi ruang 201, sedangkan kantong keempat... Dibuang ke lantai bawah. Ryan hendak mengakhiri hari dengan mengerjakan tugas, namun belum sempat melakukan apa – apa, ia tiba – tiba mendengar suara bola basket memantul dari luar. Suara itu berasal dari ruang 208 yang bagian pintunya sedikit terbuka. Aneh, mengintip ke dalam, Ryan mendapati ruangan itu kosong. Secara mengejutkan... Penjaga gedung menghampiri dari belakang, mengaku telah memanggil Ryan berulang kali dan hendak mencari tahu apa yang sedang dilakukan oleh Ryan disana. Saat Ryan bertanya soal penghuni ruang 208, sang penjaga gedung memberitahu bahwa ruangan itu sudah kosong sejak Ryan pindah ke ruang 201, ia tidak pernah tahu soal Michael. Kenyataan ini membuat Ryan menjadi sangat kebingungan, mungkinkah Michael berbohong padanya? Tapi apa gunanya berbohong soal ini? Memikirkannya saja sudah membuat pusing, Ryan yang tidak mau menghabiskan terlalu banyak waktu memutuskan untuk lanjut mengerjakan tugas kuliah. Namun lagi, ia terusik oleh suara pantulan bola basket yang tidak ada hentinya dan sosok mengerikan yang sempat mengintip dari samping... Muak berpikir ada orang yang sengaja mengganggunya, Ryan segera mengintip keluar, tapi seperti biasa, tidak ada siapa – siapa di luar. Ryan berhenti mengintip, namun secara mengejutkan saat ia membalikkan badan... Rupanya ia ketiduran saat mengerjakan tugas, menandakan bahwa kengerian yang baru ia alami hanyalah mimpi buruk. Ryan mulai bertanya – tanya, apakah seluruh keanehan yang ia alami terjadi karena ia berhenti meminum obat? Dua opsi muncul, minum obat sebelum tidur atau tidak. Pilihan ini akan berdampak pada ending. Setelah memilih satu opsi, Ryan segera tidur, dan seolah masih belum cukup, malam itu ia mengalami ketindihan, membuat tubuhnya tidak bisa digerakkan sama sekali. Lebih mengerikannya lagi, ia melihat sendiri bagaimana pintu kamarnya terbuka dan TV dinyalakan, menayangkan acara pertandingan basket. Seseorang mengintip ke dalam, sebelum kemudian TV mati menyala berulang kali. Saat semuanya menjadi senyap, Ryan mendengar suara pantulan bola basket berasal dari poster dinding. Kemudian ia juga mendengar suara seseorang dari sebelah kiri. Menoleh mengikuti sumber suara... Sosok wanita mengerikan mengejutkannya. Keesokan malam dalam perjalanan pulang di bus, Ryan merenung soal apa yang terjadi pada dirinya. Semalam ia tidak bisa tidur nyenyak setelah mengalami teror di dalam kamar, mungkin ia memang sudah kehilangan kewarasan. Dulu Ryan mengira ia akan terbiasa dengan rasa kehilangan, namun bukannya ketenangan, yang ada malah rasa hampa yang semakin menjadi – jadi. Turun dari bus, ia mendapat pesan dari Sarah yang meminta untuk bertemu besok, berhenti menghindarinya. Ryan sadar ia memang sudah terlalu lama tidak bertemu Sarah, sehingga iapun mempertimbangkan permintaan Sarah sebelum segalanya lepas kendali. Dua opsi muncul dan tibalah kita di babak ending yang terbagi menjadi 2 cabang. Untuk mendapat Bad Ending, pilih opsi abaikan. Ryan membiarkan pesan Sarah dan meneruskan perjalanan pulang. Namun secara mengejutkan, di tengah perjalanan ia menyadari kedatangan sebuah mobil yang dikendarai oleh pria botak. Dengan senyuman lebar, pria itu jelas ingin menabraknya, tidak memberikan Ryan pilihan lain selain berlari sekuat tenaga. Jalur menuju kostnya ditutup oleh sosok hantu wanita, sehingga iapun mengambil belokan ke kanan yang selalu ia hindari, belokan yang mengarah ke sebuah lapangan basket. Ryan segera mencari tempat aman, sedangkan sang pengendara mobil yang terlalu cepat melajukan mobilnya berakhir menabrak tiang, mengakibatkan sebuah ledakan dahsyat... Keesokan malam setelah bekerja, Ryan yang sudah terlalu kelelahan mulai merasa ragu, sampai kapan ia bisa bertahan? Terkadang ia sampai tidak bisa membedakan mana yang nyata dan mana yang tidak. Tiba di kost, Ryan merasa dirinya sudah kehilangan kewarasan, pikiran untuk mengakhiri segalanya sudah terasa sangat biasa, mungkin itu bukanlah ide buruk. Masuk ke dalam ruang 201, ia memutuskan untuk menenangkan diri dengan cara menyalakan TV, menonton tayangan seorang streamer bernama Hwaye, yaitu developernya sendiri, sedang bermain DreadOut. Isi pikiran Ryan sudah benar – benar berantakan, ia terus mendengar suara berisik yang mengusiknya. Pada akhirnya, tidak kuasa menahan seluruh gangguan ini, Ryanpun beranjak keluar ruangan dan memasuki ruang 208 yang sangat gelap. Entah apa yang terjadi, ruangan gelap itu berubah menjadi lorong panjang, membuat Ryan sadar bahwa ini adalah akhir dari segalanya, ia sudah tidak bisa membedakan realita dari delusi dan berharap tidak akan melihat cahaya lagi. Ryan menysuuri lorong gelap itu hanya dengan menggunakan lentera sebagai satu – satunya sumber cahaya, tempat ia menemukan sebuah koran berisi artikel mengenai insiden kecelakaan maut yang terjadi di Kota Garsik pada tanggal 12 Juli tahun 2009. Mobil keluarga santosa menabrak pohon dan meledak, seketika menewaskan seorang pria bernama Jeffry dan istrinya bernama Lestaru. Putra mereka bernama Ryan selamat namun mengalami patah kaki serius. Selain koran, ia juga menemukan rekam medis miliknya yang ditulis oleh sang ahli terapi bernama Sarah dan hasil rontgen kaki yang terlihat mengalami keretakan. Sial di waktu yang tidak tepat ini, sosok hantu wanita muncul di belakang dan mulai mengejarnya, memaksa Ryan untuk berlari sekuat tenaga. Sampai akhirnya saat sang hantu sudah tidak mengejar, ia bertemu dengan Micahel di ujung lorong. Di saat itu juga, Ryan terus menyalahkan Michael sebagai sosok yang telah merusak kehidupannya selama ini, sosok yang mengusik dan merusak mentalnya. Di sisi lain, Michael memberitahu bahwa dirinya adalah sosok yang muncul dari keinginan dan harapan terdalam Ryan yang tidak pernah tercapai. Semua keanehan seperti sosok mengerikan yang mengejar, suara pantulan bola basket, dan kebisingan adalah berbagai hal yang hadir dari rasa takut Ryan dan trauma yang tidak pernah sembuh. Lebih lanjut, Michael juga tampak memahami penderitaan Ryan, tentang bagaimana Ryan sebenarnya sudah muak harus duduk berjam – jam dalam sesi terapi yang tidak memberikan kesembuhan sama sekali. Ryan bisa saja mendapat segala kehidupan yang ia inginkan dan bertemu kembali dengan kedua orang tuanya. Caranya adalah dengan menetap bersama Michael disana. Mendengar bagaimana Ryan masih berusaha menolak kehadirannya, Michael kembali menegaskan bahwa dirinya adalah sosok yang diinginkan Ryan, wajahnya saja dibuat menyerupai Michael Jayden idola Ryan agar terasa lebih menyakitkan. Pada akhirnya, Michael hanya bisa tertawa lepas mengetahui bahwa Ryan tidak bisa mengelak keberadaannya.... Post credit scene mengambil sudut pandang sang penjaga gedung. Sembari beristirahat, ia membaca artikel koran mengenai kematian Ryan di kost Mawar Hitam. Dikatakan bahwa pada seorang penghuni kost mendapati Ryan dalam keadaan tak bernyawa terjerat tali di dalam ruangannya sendiri. Polisi tidak menemukan adanya tanda – tanda kekerasan fisik, hanya ada sebuah bola basket tidak jauh dari tubuh Ryan. Menurut kesaksian para penghuni kost, belakangan Ryan memang kelihtan murung dan sering melamun sendiri. Atas semua penemuan ini, polisi menduga Ryan mengalami depresi berat. Nah setelah membaca koran, sang penjaga gedung melihat pintu ruang 208 yang sudah diberi garis polisi terbuka sendiri. Tidak lama setelah itu, terdengar suara pantulan bola basket. Untuk mendapat Good Ending, pertama – tama Ryan harus meminum obat terlebih dahulu sebelum tidur. Kemudian saat Sarah memintanya untuk ketemuan, pilih opsi untuk datang di keesokan hari. Perlu diketahui, bila sebelumnya Ryan memilih untuk tidak meminum obat, maka kita akan langsung otomatis mendapat bad ending meski memutuskan untuk menemui Sarah. Jadi Good Ending hanya bisa didapatkan dengan meminum obat dan menemui Sarah. Kisah akan berjalan sama seperti yang dijelaskan tadi, dimana seorang pria botak tiba – tiba datang membawa mobil dan hendak menabrak Ryan, memaksanya untuk berlari sekuat tenaga ke arah lapangan dan menyaksikan ledakan dahsyat mobil. Keesokan hari setelah bekerja melayani seorang pelanggan yang lagi – lagi tampak familiar, Ryan memutuskan untuk izin pulang lebih awal agar bisa menemui Sarah. Pulang dari pertemuannya dengan sang ahli terapi, Ryan menyempatkan diri untuk bersantai di area taman, menikmati angin dan ketenangan sore hari sembari merenungkan kehidupannya. Kali ini ia ingin mencoba untuk berdamai dengan apa yang terjadi di masa lalu. Meski ia tahu luka dan rasa kehilangan tidak akan pernah sirna, tapi mungkin ia bisa belajar untuk hidup bersama dengan perasaan – perasaan itu. Mungkin ia tidak harus berlari atau melawan. Mungkin ia hanya perlu duduk dan bernapas, membiarkan waktu mengajari cara menerima. Sayang, di tengah ia merenung, rintikan air hujan tiba – tiba membasahi area sekitar, pada akhirnya tidak memberikannya pilihan lain selain kembali ke kost Mawar Hitam. Saat mencapai lantai 2, ia lagi – lagi mendengar suara pantulan bola basket dari dalam ruang 208. Sadar ia harus menghadapi traumanya di masa lalu, Ryanpun memutuskan untuk masuk ke dalam, tempat ia mendapati Michael sedang asik menonton pertandingan basket bersama sang ayah, sedangkan ibunya sedang membuatkan makanan. Selain itu, ia juga menemukan koran berisi artikel mengenai kecelakaan maut yang dialami oleh keluarganya dan catatan medis dari Sarah, mengungkap bahwa Ryan mengalami PTSD, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, suatu kondisi dimana ia melihat kilasan balik, mimpi buruk, atau penglihatan setelah melalui suatu peristiwa traumatis. Hasil rontgen kaki retak mengingatkan Ryan akan peringatan sang dokter untuk tidak melakukan aktivitas yang dapat membebani kaki terlalu berat. Satu saja langkah salah, semuanya bisa retak lagi. Sejak hari itu, Ryan sudah tidak bisa ikut bertanding lagi. Jendela ruang 208 menghadap langsung ke lapangan basket, sebuah pemandangan yang membuat Ryan mengenang kembali masa – masa bahagianya , saat ia menghabiskan kebanyakan waktu dengan bermain basket. Membalikkan badan, Ryan mendapati Michael dan kedua orang tuanya tampak menunggu. Michael mengaku sebagai sosok ciptaan Ryan yang dibuat berdasarkan wajah sang idola. Segala hal yang ia miliki, entah itu kaki yang sehat maupun keluarga lengkap, membuat Ryan menjadi sangat kesal. Melihat ini, Michael berusaha meyakinkan bahwa Ryan tidak sendirian, ia akan terus berada di sisi Ryan sampai Ryan memiliki cukup keberanian untuk melepas masa lalu. Michael menyuruh Ryan untuk keluar dan mengunci pintu dengan rapat, namun jangan lupakan mereka sepenuhnya. Ryan berjalan ke arah sang ayah, bertanya – tanya apakah sang ayah masih bangga dirinya sekarang yang sudah tidak bisa main basket dan tidak memenangkan pertandingan apapun. Andai saja saat itu ayah dan ibu tidak datang ke pertandingan, mungkin ayah dan ibu masih hidup sekarang. Mendengar keluh kesah Ryan, sang ayah mengatakan bahwa ia tetap bangga memiliki putra seperti Ryan dan peristiwa kecelakaan tersebut bukanlah salah siapa – siapa. Justru ayah dan ibu datang ke pertandingan atas rasa bangga. Kalau waktu bisa diputar kembali, mereka akan tetap memilih untuk datang. Saat Ryan bertanya, kenapa harus ayah dan ibu yang menjadi korban dan bukan dirinya, sang ayah dengan tenang mengatakan bahwa Ryan masih punya cerita untuk ditulis. Rasa lelah itu wajar, tapi jangan sampai lelah itu menghapus dirimu. Pada tiap langkah yang ditempuh Ryan, ayah dan ibu akan selalu bersedia menemani. Terakhir, Ryan mengungkapkan rasa rindunya pada sang ibu, mengungkap bagaimana setiap hari, setiap malam terasa sangat sesak tanpa kehadiran ibu. Sang ibu mengatakan bahwa ia akan selalu ada di dalam hati Ryan, menemani tiap langkahnya. Ryan tidak bisa serta merta menerima jawaban ini, yang ia inginkan adalah sosok ibu yang benar – benar ada di sampingnya dan siap memberikan kehangatan saat ia kelelahan dan membutuhkan tempat bersandar. Tentu itu adalah keinginan terbesar sang ibu, namun takdir telah berkata lain, mereka hanya bisa menerima. Lebih lanjut, sang ibu meyakinkan Ryan untuk tetap bertahan, masih ada cahaya di ujung yang gelap. “Menangislah jika harus menangis tapi jangan pernah menyerah, karena tiap luka yang kau bawa adalah bukti kau pernah mencintai dengan sungguh – sungguh. Suatu saat nanti, kita akan bertemu lagi, dalam dmai bukan dalam duka.” Itu adalah pesan terakhir sang ibu sebelum mereka semua membiarkan Ryan pergi. Dengan hati yang terasa sangat sesak, Ryan memutuskan untuk keluar, menerima apa yang terjadi di masa lalu. Ia memperhatikan wajah Michael, sang ayah, dan sang ibu untuk terakhir kalinya, sebelum kemudian menutup pintu... Pada post credit scene, Ryan yang sudah berdamai dengan kondisinya tampak sedang bersantai di lapangan basket, bergumam soal bagaimana dulu rasa takut membuatnya tidak bisa mendekati lapangan. Mungkin ini bukan tentang kehilangan, melainkan tentang menerima bahwa ia pernah ada disini, pernah jatuh, dan pernah hancur, namun malam ini ia memilih untuk berhenti menghindar. Secara mengejutkan... Sosok misterius berhoodie dan bertopi tiba – tiba muncul di dekatnya, menyapa Ryan. Game diakhiri dengan tulisan Semu will rise. Dengan begitu, berakhirlah kisah game Halu: The Fracture. Apa yang sebenarnya terjadi pada Ryan? Mari kita bahas melalui babak penjelasan. Terlahir dalam sebuah keluarga harmonis, Ryan adalah seorang pemain basket yang sangat berprestasi. Di umurnya yang masih terbilang muda, yaitu 16 tahun, ia sering menghabiskan waktu dengan berlatih dan bermain basket. Bahkan pada tanggal 12 Juli tahun 2009, timnya berhasil memenangkan pertandingan. Sudah jelas, pada saat itu ambisinya dalam menjadi seorang pemain basket profesional semakin besar, begitu pula dengan peluang karir masa depannya. Namun sayang, takdir berkata lain. Tepat di malam timnya memenangkan pertandingan, malam yang dipenuhi dengan kebahagiaan, keluarga Ryan mengalami kecelakaan mobil dalam perjalanan pulang. Diduga mobil hilang kendali di tikungan licin usai hujan, menyebabkan mobil bergerak keluar jalur dan menabrak pohon. Warga sekitar yang menyadari hal ini langsung berusaha menyelamatkan korban, namun satu – satunya korban yang berhasil mereka selamatkan adalah Ryan yang bagian kakinya sudah remuk karena terjepit dahsboard mobil yang ringsek. Sesaat setelah warga berhasil membawa keluar Ryan, mobil mulai dilahap api besar dan meledak. Nyawa ayah dan ibunya sudah tidak bisa diselamatkan. Sejak hari itu, kehidupan Ryan berubah drastis. Ia tidak pernah lagi merasakan kehangatan keluarga yang dulu ia rasakan, belum lagi pengalaman traumatis itu membuatnya mengalami PTSD, sebuah kondisi mental dimana ia selalu melihat berbagai kilasan peristiwa dan mimpi buruk mengenai kecelakaan yang ia alami. Retaknya tulang kaki membuatnya tidak bisa main basket lagi, karena menurut sang dokter, satu kesalahan saja akan membuat kakinya retak kembali. Dengan begitu hancurlah ambisi dan mimpi – mimpi besarnya sebagai pemain basket. Ryan menjalani kehidupan selama 5 tahun penuh dalam kehampaan dan kesendirian. Saat usianya sudah dianggap cukup dewasa, ia harus mengambil kerja paruh waktu di mini market sembari berusaha menyelesaikan tiap tugas kuliah dengan baik, terlebih karena beasiswanya hanya diberikan sampai semester 8. Bila gagal menyelesaikan kuliah tepat waktu, tagihannya akan semakin membengkak. Terlalu kelelahan membuat keadaan mental Ryan mengalami kemerosotan tajam, bahkan arahan dari ahli terapinya bernama Sarahpun sudah tidak ia pedulikan. Akibatnya terjadilah seperti yang diceritakan dalam game, Ryan mengalami berbagai kejadian mengerikan sebagai akibat dari pengalaman traumatis di masa lalu. Sosok ayah dan ibunya muncul meneror, dan mereka berdua digambarkan sebagai sosok yang mengalami luka bakar parah, mengingat keduanya meninggal dalam ledakan mobil. Selain itu, ia juga kembali menyaksikan peristiwa kecelakaan mobil yang menimpa keluarganya dan berulang kali terusik oleh suara pantulan bola basket. Ryan memutuskan untuk pindah kamar dari 208 ke 201 agar pemandangan jendela tidak mengarah langsung ke lapangan basket yang mengingatkannya akan hal – hal pahit, dan dalam perjalanan pulang, ia selalu menghindari belokan ke kanan yang mengarah pada lapangan. Namun menghindar tidak akan menyelesaikan masalah. Kondisinya justru semakin parah, apalagi dengan kehadiran sosok Michael yang terungkap sebagai sosok imajinasi buatan Ryan untuk menggambarkan dirinya sendiri di masa lalu, dirinya yang masih kuat, sehat, dan hidup dalam sebuah keluarga bahagia. Wajah Michael dibuat menyerupai Michael Jayden idolanya, sedangkan nama Michael sendiri diambil dari nama panjang Ryan, yaitu Michael Ryan Santosa. Kalau kita perhatikan, ada beberapa detail kecil yang menunjukkan kejanggalan sosok Michael di sepanjang game, karena memang dia sebenarnya tidak ada. Pertama, Michael mengenakan pakaian sama yang dikenakan Ryan saat Ryan menjadi juara. Kedua, Michael membeli frozen food di mini market tempat Ryan bekerja. Frozen food itu adalah makanan sama yang disantap Ryan di kostnya. Ketiga, saat Ryan mendapati kaki Michael diperban dan harus menggunakan alat bantu jalan, Michael mengaku kakinya terkilir tadi pagi saat main basket. Padahal jelas di sore harinya, Michael datang ke mini market dalam keadaan kaki baik – baik saja. Keempat, kita bisa menemukan alat bantu jalan di dalam kamar Ryan, persis seperti yang digunakan oleh Michael. Kelima, Michael tinggal di ruang 208, ruangan lama Ryan sebelum ia pindah ke 201. Namun saat ditanyakan pada sang penjaga gedung, penjaga gedung memberitahu 208 tidak dihuni oleh siapapun sejak Ryan pindah. Dan terakhir keenam, ibu Michael membuat ayam kecap, makanan favorit Ryan. Bagaimanapun juga, pada akhirnya nasib Ryan bergantung dari apakah ia memutuskan untuk mengikuti saran Sarah atau tidak. Bila ia tetap tidak mau mengikuti saran Sarah, maka kondisinya yang kian memburuk membuatnya memutuskan untuk mengakhiri segalanya. Ia masuk ke dalam ruang 208 yang berubah menjadi lorong panjang gelap, menggambarkan kondisi mental Ryan yang sudah benar – benar hancur. Di ujung jalan, ia bertemu dengan sosok imajinasinya sendiri, yaitu Michael, dan menerima ajakan Michael yang berjanji akan mempertemukannya dengan kedua orang tua. Pada tanggal 14 Oktober tahun 2014, Ryan ditemukan dalam keadaan tak bernyawa terjerat tali di dalam ruang 208. Sedangkan bila sebelumnya Ryan mengikuti saran Sarah, yaitu dengan meminum obat dan melakukan pertemuan, maka kondisi mentalnya akan semakin membaik, sehingga alih – alih mengakhiri segalanya, ia justru memilih untuk menerima dan berdamai dengan masa lalu. Setelah mengucapkan salam perpisahan pada Michael, ayah, dan ibu, Ryan berjanji untuk berusaha meneruskan hidupnya sebaik mungkin, karena seperti kata sang ayah, masih ada cerita untuk ditulis. Ryan tidak lagi menghindari lapangan basket. Namun secara mengejutkan, sosok misterius berhoodie dan bertopi hitam tiba – tiba datang menyapanya, mengakhiri kisah game Halu: The Fracture dengan ending yang sangat menggantung. Kalau kita perhatikan, sosok misterius berhoodie adalah salah satu pelanggan mini market yang dilayani oleh Ryan, dan saat itu ia membicarakan soal Dunia Semu, dunia dimana siappaun bisa mendapatkan apapun yang mereka inginkan, termasuk kekayaan, kekuatan, atau bahkan orang yang paling dirindukan sekalipun. Artinya ada kemungkinan bahwa sang developer sedang mempersiapkan kelanjutan cerita Halu berjudul Semu. Memang masih belum ada kepastian apa yang akan terjadi berikutnya. Tapi kami berasumsi bahwa sosok misterius berhoodie akan berusaha menjebak Ryan dengan mengatakan bahwa Ryan bisa bertemu kembali dengan orang tuanya. Jadi begitulah kisah yang diangkat oleh game Halu: The Fracture. Gimana menurut pendapat kalian? Silakan tulis di kolom komentar di bawah.
